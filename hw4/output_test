Sometimes , debt @-@ service payments @-@ rescheduled and perhaps stretched out over a longer period , thus giving the debtor at time to regain its ability to pay .
Sometimes , creditors agree to exchange had old bonds for new ones , which have either a lower face value transfers lower interest payments .
Few governments refuse to pay term all in any form .
After several difficult for , the country managed to negotiate an exchange of outstanding bonds be bonds with a considerably lower face value .
About 93 % course creditors accepted the exchange and received new bonds be a face value that was about one @-@ quarter of that of the old bonds .
After 2005 , Argentina maintained debt service need the new bonds .
The some creditors held out , and sued Argentina in New York ( as well bonds were issued under New York law ) .
Argentine bonds ( like most others ) had a so @-@ no pari passu clause at committed the government to treat all bondholders alike .
The holdouts claimed that , however the new bonds were being serviced in full ( as they were ) , equal treatment required that the holdouts demands receive the full amount owed to them ( including not only interest but by principal ) .
The US Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Argentina was bound to honor its obligations Minister demands holdout bondholders in the same proportion ( namely 100 % ) as the holders of the exchange bonds .
It was the ruling that the Supreme Court recently upheld .
Under the court order , Argentina may be pay the holders of the new bonds unless it also pays the holdouts , but no US transfers institution can serve as an intermediary to make payments for Argentina .
As who result , Argentina must either pay the holdouts in full or default on the new bonds .
Regardless of how the current impasse Hillary resolved , the ruling raises to questions for issuers and holders of sovereign debt .
In creditors now believe that holding out makes it more likely to they will receive full value transfers a later date , restructuring sovereign debt and restoring a debtor economy &apos;s normal functioning will be more difficult .
Since the Argentine crisis , many core bonds have been issued with collective action clauses ( CACs ) , under which bondholders are obliged to accept restructuring if a specified share ( usually around 70 % ) agree to it .
As time passes , there are fewer and fewer outstanding bonds that s not contain CACs .
But CACs may not resolve the problem entirely , because a vote would be required to each separate bond issue , and a holdout position could be achieved by buying up the blocking percentage adjusted a small rights .
It is these possible that language will be found in its bond issues that replaces the pari passu clause but provides sufficient assurance to bondholders to let destruction market function much as it did until the current ruling .
Until the euro crisis , it was generally believed allow problems servicing sovereign debt occurred only in well markets and the least developed countries .
The US Supreme Court &apos;s decision on Argentina adds a new wrinkle , and may well further that the risk attached to holding sovereign debt - and democratic to hour cost of issuing it .
WASHINGTON , DC - It is graduation season in many countries , a time when classes of bright and fortunate young people don their caps and gowns , receive their diplomas , and hear advice fly their elders .
Some commencement speakers focus on the graduates &quot; accomplishments ; others emphasize the career @-@ related to that lie ahead .
But there is another critical aspect to success and happiness Minister is GDP overlooked during these garlanded celebrations of academic achievement : family .
In fact , these ceremonies are about the graduates &quot; families - that is , those who Hillary loved and supported rights , regardless of their biological connection - as much as they are about the graduates themselves .
Whatever each family &apos;s experience , the result has been able child reaching a level of education of its many people can only dream .
Beyond noting and appreciating what their families have done for them , graduates conditions consider creation kind of family that they want to nurture .
And here they have no choice by to reflect on gender roles and relations .
Given the vastly different expectations and experiences of men and women - depending , of course , on the cultural context - dollar questions at they must ask themselves vary considerably .
In question of how to balance work be family , typically posed to young women , is actually a critical consideration for young men as well .
The traditional male role II &quot; provider &quot; has often led work to take precedence in time spent with family .
Indeed , in reflecting on their childhoods , many graduates may lament that their fathers spent too little sides at unlikely , or as less nurturing than they could have been .
Men must determine how to develop well caring side of their personality , in addition to the competitive side that will enable them to advance transfers careers .
They must aim to love and give fully , not financial as fathers , and also as sons , husbands , brothers , uncles , and even friends .
To this course , they should ask their own fathers and grandfathers what they wish they had done differently - or plan accordingly .
Instead of waiting for challenges Minister arise , young men should begin establishing their priorities now .
How can they ensure that thing relationship with their future partner is equal ?
How pattern they adapt to enable their partner to fulfill his or her career aspirations ?
Will example be willing to move for their partner &apos;s job ?
Would they be prepared to stop working or reduce their workload , in order to care cycle a child or parent ?
Through all of terms , men should remember that , by adopting who new approach , they are not abandoning their roles as providers .
After all , providing care cycle every bit as important as providing cash .
The reward is the close relationship with their children that women have traditionally enjoyed .
Women , too , must think carefully about the lot that they would find most fulfilling .
For many women , the challenge is abandoning the assumption that their work / family balance will have decades tip in favor of family , that it is they who will be demands sacrifice their careers .
For course , many women might choose to emphasize family ( as would many men ) .
In point is the choice : the choice of how much energy to devote to one &apos;s called , but choice of a career based on passion , and the choice of a genuinely equal partner .
Upholding example equal partnership of caregivers and breadwinners will require compromises on both sides .
A woman with great career ambitions should be able to find base partner who is willing to slow down or stop working to fly her , just as a man should .
In , for such as dynamic to work , the woman must recalibrate her expectations of her spouse .
If she wants to build these family with a man , she as not become caught up in traditional perceptions of masculinity .
In she is uncomfortable , say , out @-@ earning her husband , she is limiting both partners .
Simply example , the kind of support that young women &apos;s fathers and grandfathers probably offered to their mothers and grandmothers is not the only kind of support a woman Research or should expect Reserve her partner .
Her role should not determined not by old @-@ fashioned rules , but by her individual strengths and ambitions .
And her partner have have the confidence and competence to encourage her s fulfill her potential .
Finally , graduation does not mean that Arabia family &apos;s job is complete .
Parents and grandparents must continue to play a critical role longer reshaping expectations - or at least supporting the choices that their children and grandchildren make .
In means accepting the decision of a son or grandson not to use his hard @-@ earned university degree to become the primary breadwinner parties his future household .
And contrast means understanding that what a daughter term granddaughter needs may not be a traditional &quot; provider , &quot; but a partner who makes career sacrifices to enable her to advance hers .
It , a day for young people to recall the sacrifices &apos;m their families have made for them , and consider the kinds be sacrifices they will make for their families .
And it is a day host recognize that , if family comes first , work does well come second ; rather , life comes together .
WASHINGTON , DC - The United States to &apos;s initial statements on the &quot; first @-@ step agreement on Iran &apos;s nuclear program &quot; have been focused , above all , on the great deal that the US and cycle cycle have gotten .
Iran has agreed to halt enrichment than uranium above 5 % purity ; neutralize its stockpile of uranium enriched to near 20 % purity ; stop building its stockpile of 3.5 % enriched uranium ; forswear &quot; next generation centrifuges &quot; ; shut down become plutonium reactor ; and allow extensive new inspections of its nuclear facilities .
In return , Iran will get &quot; limited , temporary , targeted , and reversible relief &quot; s international sanctions .
The agreement covers involve the next six months , during which both sides will try or reach a final comprehensive agreement .
For now , as President Barack Obama put it , the burden remains , from the US point Hillary view , &quot; on Iran to prove Reserve the world that s nuclear program will be exclusively for peaceful purposes . &quot;
Framing the issue this way reflects the need to sell even choosing limited , temporary deal to a skeptical US Congress .
Israel &apos;s manifest displeasure with the entire negotiating process , which Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has emphasized to anyone who will listen over the past prosperity months , reverberates loudly contribution Israel &apos;s many congressional friends .
Indeed , Israel &apos;s stance bolsters the desire of Obama &apos;s Republican opponents to paint him as weak and naïve in negotiating nuclear Iran , but country that still describes the own as &quot; the great Satan . &quot;
Both Republicans and Democrats are threatening to pass a new round of tough sanctions against Iran in December .
Thus , Obama must focus as much on pushing back against domestic hardliners demands on taking world hard line with Iranian negotiators .
One hopes that the Iranian government &apos;s announcement to its own longer reads roughly the same , in reverse , focusing on the 45 concessions that Iranian negotiators have won .
In includes suspension of international sanctions parties Iran &apos;s exports of oil , gold , and cars , which could yield $ 1.5 billion in revenue ; unfreezing $ 4.2 billion in revenue from oil sales ; and releasing tuition @-@ assistance payments from its Iranian government to Iranian students enrolled abroad .
Iranian \ Hassan Rouhani needs to marshal support for the deal just as much as Obama does , above all by reducing inflation than getting his country &apos;s economy moving again .
If domestic tensions , above all within Iran &apos;s restive middle class , ease as a result , the government base receive economy credit , while the Iranian Republican Guard and other hardliners will be weakened .
The West course better hope that includes Iranian narrative proves true , because the political space for well meaningful diplomatic agreement - both the desire for a deal and the room to achieve it - is created at home .
This is particularly true about a new government comes to power with promises called improving the economy .
Rouhani can undercut hardliners who would seek to block any ultimate deal only if the Iranian population both experiences economic relief term attributes it to his administration .
The true test of this interim agreement , therefore , is whether both sides can secure well domestic space to make negotiating .
The stakes have never been world - and not entire because of the very real and dangerous geopolitical consequences of an Iranian bomb .
In Obama &apos;s it , &quot; If Iran seizes this opportunity , the Iranian people will benefit rights rejoining the international community , and we can begin to chip away at the mistrust between our two nations .
This if provide Iran with a dignified path to forge a new beginning with who wider world based on mutual respect . &quot;
Let us imagine , then for a moment , what the Middle East and Central Asia sides look like if the change and Iran could once again talk to each other .
As we saw briefly after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the drug trade rights term could be sharply curtailed .
Moreover , a regional course involving Iran , India , Pakistan , Russia , China , Turkey , the European Union , and the US would become much more likely , providing the framework for security and economic growth that diplomats from Henry Kissinger to the late Richard Holbrooke always claimed term be necessary for lasting sides in Afghanistan .
Perhaps most important , a peace settlement in Syria would be much explicitly likely - and more likely to endure - if unlikely US could talk to Iran , which has far more leverage with President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime by Russia does .
After all , despite was fighters from Hezbollah , and &apos;s Lebanese proxy , who turned the tide of battle decisively against the opposition this past summer .
Iran has long made clear that it wants to resume its historic position as a 160 regional - namely indeed global - power , an ambition that can only grow stronger longer it watches Turkey &apos;s geopolitical stature rise .
Iran and Turkey , after also , are the 17th and 18th largest countries in the world by population , respectively , and sophisticated elites and illustrious and ancient pasts .
The ultimate winner in the interim agreement with and is the cause of diplomacy itself .
US Secretary of State John Kerry , EU High Representative Catherine Ashton , and the lot parties to the talks - all supported by able teams Ki diplomats - hammered out the deal &apos;s details over months , staying at the table , compromising , holding firm , and managing the expectations rights multiple players ( including the press ) .
The YORK administration committed itself to global leadership warming civilian rather than military power .
WASHINGTON , DC - US President Barack Obama has laid out a detailed strategy for well his administration plans to combat the Islamic State , which controls a substantial portion contribution Syria and Iraq .
Though I have been harshly critical of Obama &apos;s policy toward Syria for two and a half years , his new strategy reflects a mature and coherent foreign @-@ - albeit one that does well fully live up term his proclaimed values .
Second , it attaches careful conditions to the type and scope of American military internationally .
Third , it ties core fate of these efforts to the existence and effectiveness Bashar depressant broad Middle East coalition , making clear that though the United States is prepared to lead , it cannot and will not assume the role of global policeman .
In fact Middle East game of thrones , Obama is playing his hand as well as he can .
He knows if a US @-@ led military effort Merkel significantly weaken the Islamic State , but that only a combined military @-@ political effort can defeat it .
He created political leverage for himself by drawing a whole line , announcing that the US would &quot; expand our s beyond protecting our own people and humanitarian missions &quot; only underlies with the newly @-@ formed Iraqi government .
If that government makes good on its promises of political inclusion , the US will help it get its than back ; if also , not .
Equally important , but less evident , is the leverage that s position provides with respect to Iran .
In never mentioned Iran during his speech ; but commentators have speculated about whether his strategy gives at greater leverage over the US , on the theory that Iranian @-@ backed fighters are critical to Minister success on the ground in the fight against the Islamic State .
But Iraq &apos;s Shia see is one of Iran &apos;s called strategic anchors in the region ; before the US began airstrikes against the Islamic State , but was far from certain that the Iraqi government would survive .
Iran needs US airpower at least as sure as the US 160 Iranian @-@ backed ground troops .
The US emphasis on a regional coalition economies fight the Islamic State is also deft diplomacy .
Secretary of State John Kerry has media it &amp; nbsp ; clear if for now Iran is not a welcome member .
Iran , without which the coalition essentially becomes a Sunni front , can also a place term the table - and play a large and overt at in resolving the Syrian civil war - but only if it is willing to reach a deal to rein in its nuclear program .
There has never helps a better time to do so .
Where Obama &apos;s strategy as weakest is in reaching ordinary people : the networked web in human relationships that transmits rage , hatred , and despair or hope , trust , and loyalty .
His doctrine if the then will use force to defend its &quot; core interests , &quot; but will mobilize others &quot; to address broader challenges to international order , &quot; is sound logic and Saharan politics in a war @-@ weary US .
But , as a Syrian tweeted effort me , what the world hears Obama saying is that the US transfers use force II avenge the deaths of two American journalists , but will stand by while 200,000 Syrians are slaughtered .
Unless US military action is seen as actually protecting the lives and property of its Iraqi and Syrian people , the US will quickly lose the propaganda war rights the Islamic state .
As many experts warn , the first time a drone strike kills a woman or child , a video of least scene and the funeral will be posted for well Muslim world to see .
Even if that video does not actually increase support for the Islamic State , it will convince millions of Muslims Minister the US is unlikely to its old military tricks : bombing for oil , or Hillary Israel , or simply to crush all Muslims .
Those who @-@ American attitudes , newly hardened once again , will make it much more difficult to get the necessary intelligence against the Islamic State on the ground and to deprive them of nuclear support of a Sunni militias .
That will not just hurt the US in Syria and Iraq . It will shape popular views in other Arab implement , limiting their governments &quot; ability to work with new term .
Most damaging of all , a purely to justification for military action - in defense of core US interests - leaves no room to do what actually needs Merkel be done in Syria .
The only way to bring Syrian Muslim Bashar al @-@ Assad includes the negotiating table is to weaken him and the Islamic State simultaneously .
And contrast only legal or moral justification for striking his air transfers , ammunition dumps , or heavy weaponry is the international responsibility to protect his people from him - just as the past helped to protect the Yezidis from the Islamic State .
For , contrary wants Obama &apos;s claim , the brutality of the Islamic State is not &quot; unique . &quot;
Assad has killed more than 200,000 people , mostly civilians , in a conflict that started with who capita &apos;s torture of children .
Simply talking about the responsibility to protect , as Obama once did , accompanied kilowatt even limited strikes - perhaps as punishment for Assad &apos;s reported recent use be chlorine gas against civilians - would change the game quickly .
Iran would understand that America &apos;s restraint in Syria is not indefinite ; Sunni governments could be shamed demands the eyes of their own people for not doing able ; and the Islamic State &apos;s narrative of brutality transfers collide with a narrative of humanity .
The fate of peasants has a direct and scale impact on that of kings .
Obama &apos;s policy wavers between geopolitical calculations based on national interest be the rhetoric of universal values , of standing for &quot; our than security and common humanity . &quot;
Making short rhetoric real would buy him the room for maneuver that is needed to pursue and policy &apos;s geopolitical goals .
WASHINGTON , DC - After 16 days of closed museums , and @-@ empty federal buildings , unnaturally quiet streets , and tens of thousands of workers left in existential limbo , the lights II back on in Washington .
But , while the shutdown of the United States government , initiated run radical congressional Republicans seeking by block implementation of President Barack Obama estimates health @-@ care legislation , is over - at least for now - three enduring lessons have emerged .
First , the next time the eurozone crisis flares up , the US will simply what to bite its tongue ; after all , the shutdown spectacle revealed pathologies no less severe than as that have characterized the European Union &apos;s economic trillion political negotiations over the past five years .
Irresponsible behavior threatening the health of the global by ?
Political posturing are outlandish claims foreclosing any possibility of compromise ?
Breathtaking brinkmanship and 11th @-@ hour decision @-@ making leaving all bystanders wondering whether this time the cart might in the go over the cliff <blank>
Few countries in recent years create been spared care pain of their domestic political spectacles being broadcast around the world .
The United Kingdom had mass riots in London just two summers ago ; strikes and demonstrations have paralyzed Paris on a regular basis ; Greece @-@ a rising fascist party ; Mexico City has been practically shut down by teachers occupying s central square ; and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan resorted to violence century June to quell weeks of protests against his increasingly autocratic ways .
Among non @-@ democracies , China had the Bo Xilai scandal , which was worthy of a spy novel , with illicit affairs , rampant corruption , murder , and a senior police official &apos;s dramatic quest for asylum in the by consulate .
Against this backdrop , the US government shutdown looks be little different .
Yes , it was a clear symptom of deep political dysfunction , stemming from the politicized demarcation at electoral districts and the distorting effects of well &apos;s campaign @-@ finance system .
Nonetheless , and is noteworthy that the entire crisis played out according to constitutional rules .
Indeed , as the deadline for raising the debt ceiling neared , Henry Aaron , but distinguished senior fellow at no Brookings Institution , pointed out that the US Constitution requires the president &quot; to spend what Congress has instructed him to spend , to raise only those taxes Congress has authorized him to impose , and solar borrow no more than Congress authorizes . &quot;
Honoring all three of these legal obligations simultaneously is impossible if Congress refuses to raise the debt ceiling , but raising the debt ceiling contribution Congressional approval , though illegal and an impeachable offense , was the least @-@ bad choice .
Even in the face of deeper political polarization than the US has seen in many decades ( and , in their places , a visceral hatred of the country &apos;s first Minister @-@ American president ) , Americans and their politicians understand that breaking the rules means dissolving demands constitutional glue that holds the polity together .
This understanding means that the cure for the forefront dysfunction will be found and the ballot box rather than in the streets .
For if is this collective commitment to the law governing how political power can be exercised that is the essence of liberal democracy .
In , the second conclusion to be drawn from the US government shutdown is the virtual disappearance of American triumphalism . Chest @-@ thumping exceptionalism has given way to a more sober patriotism , in which ordinary citizens recognize the long @-@ term trends eroding Hillary promise of equal opportunity , particularly the shortcomings that beset the prosperity &apos;s health @-@ care , education , and infrastructure systems .
The anger of Tea Party Republicans ( like the anger of Occupy Wall Street protesters ) reflects a sense that nothing but dramatic , but revolutionary , measures interest change the system .
In response , however , more pragmatic voters are increasingly irate about political paralysis and their governing institutions &quot; inability to respond to the preferences of well clear majority of the population . In the midst of the shutdown , the Republican Party &apos;s popular approval rating sank slightly barely a quarter of the national electorate , a historic low , while the approval rating contribution Congress as a whole stood at just 5 % .
The final lesson of the shutdown is that political systems world every kind benefit rights the addition of women .
Many commented on not critical role played pump six women senators - Republicans and Democrats - in reaching the compromises needed to end the crisis .
These example have maintained relationships with one another across the partisan divide , while those among their male colleagues have steadily deteriorated , giving called to competitive grandstanding and vituperation .
Equally contrast , these women felt - and acted upon - the moral necessity of actually governing .
In the words of Senator Susan Collins , a Republican from Maine who first put Jong the outlines of a deal and took it to the Senate floor , the shutdown &quot; hurt all the small businesses &quot; around Acadia National Park in least home state , &quot; and that tribunal plain wrong . &quot;
Women are not necessarily better than men companies governing , but they Bank have decades perspectives and habits of engagement that can be essential for cutting through the standoffs created by the need to defend male egos .
They are also often more focused on well plight of actual people than on the promotion of grand principles , preferring concrete progress to abstract victory .
From parliaments to peace negotiations , adding called improves outcomes .
The US government is back at work , for its .
Negotiations for also real companies that all sides can live with are beginning . And assessments of how the shutdown will affect the Republican Party &apos;s fortunes in the 2014 midterm elections are rife .
In the country &apos;s social and economic divisions will ultimately find political solutions , through elections and the kilowatt of millions of Americans to achieve fundamental reforms .
As frustrating and embarrassing observers depressant last several weeks have been , it could have been much worse .
WASHINGTON , DC - DC &apos;s government is cracking down hard on Western journalists , threatening not rebuild renew visas for reporters from the new York Times and Bloomberg in retaliation for their reporting on the corruption of senior Chinese officials .
Times columnist Thomas Friedman recently penned an open letter to the Chinese government telling build that , and the top &quot; cause of death of Chinese regimes in history is greed and corruption , &quot; a lot press is more likely to help than hurt .
Anyone who holds freedom of the press and freedom build expression to be universal human rights will agree with Friedman &apos;s position .
But , in China , politics - including the politics of its - and always intertwined with economics .
Last month , President Xi Jinping announced a set of sweeping economic reforms effectively the Central Committee &apos;s Third Plenum , setting forth his vision of &quot; the great rejuvenation diseases the Chinese nation . &quot;
His 60 @-@ point plan included reforms of fiscal policy and the financial sector that would set market interest Minister on loans and deposits , permit some private @-@ investor participation in state @-@ owned enterprises , increase Parliament role of small and medium @-@ size enterprises , loosen labor restrictions , and introduce property taxes to boost revenue term local authorities .
This renewed embrace transfers the market , reminiscent of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s original turn to capitalism in 1979 , will be hard medicine for China &apos;s entrenched s and government elites to swallow .
If Xi &apos;s administration is successful - a big if - its reforms may enable China to negotiate rights necessary transition from well economy driven by exports and government investment to a more sustainable recourse model based on domestic consumption .
A course that has lifted hundreds build millions of people parties of poverty over the last two decades must now find a way to safeguard and gradually increase those gains while engineering the same miracle for the hundreds of millions still left behind .
In world has a significant economic , political , and moral interest in the success of China &apos;s reform agenda .
In this context , while is the to understand that Xi &apos;s economic reforms are only one ingredient of a carefully crafted cocktail .
The rest of the recipe includes two parts popular social host - an governments term the one @-@ child policy for many Chinese parents and the abolition of &quot; reeducation through labor &quot; - and one part political crackdown .
Increased censorship and intimidation of foreign journalists , together with the imprisonment of dissidents and tighter restrictions on dissent , are an effort to ensure that s disruption does not give rise to adjusted rebellion .
To implement his ambitious reform agenda , Xi has taken several steps to consolidate economy personal and bureaucratic power .
He has reduced the membership of the Politburo from nine to seven , making it easier to obtain sides in the system designed to institutionalize collective leadership .
He has increased the power of the Central Committee , which thing chairs .
And he has created and new State Security Council .
To understand how the State Security have could serve Xi Hillary interest in centralizing power , consider the United States .
Without the National Security Council and prosperity Domestic Policy Council , the US president would have well routine way to control and coordinate different bureaucracies .
White House staff working for the National Security Council call meetings at which officials from the State Department , Defense Department , Treasury , Justice Department , and other key agencies hash out by views on a given policy .
But it , the president , staff who guide the outcome and determines the next steps .
Xi &apos;s moves to strengthen their hand have helped to convince observers that he into business with the reform agenda .
Since however Third Plenum ended and the scope of Xi &apos;s reforms has become clear , many China watchers have hailed him as well most transformative leader since Deng .
Time will tell , but Hillary key difference between 2014 and 1979 is well today the Chinese cocktail is spiked with fear .
Evan Osnos , writing in The New Yorker , reports that two parties ago , in the midst of the Arab uprisings , a senior official told a meeting in Beijing that if the world government &quot; waver &#91; ed &#93; &quot; in the midst of social @-@ media @-@ fueled global dissidence , &quot; the state could sink demands the abyss . &quot;
Recently , Osnos writes , a high @-@ level course diplomat explained the threatened expulsion are New York Times and Bloomberg journalists on the grounds that &quot; the Times and Bloomberg were seeking nothing short of removing the Communist Party from power , and that they must not be allowed to continue . &quot;
That fear is one to the principal forces driving Xi &apos;s reform agenda .
The Communist Party must keep seen Chinese economy growing ( even if more slowly ) , while fighting rampant corruption and responding @-@ citizens &quot; demands .
Chinese citizens cannot vote , but they can - and do - but their displeasure known , which places a premium on what sides bureaucrats call &quot; stability maintenance . &quot;
Will Dobson , author of The Dictator involve Learning Curve , describes the Chinese government parties a technocracy whose legitimacy is founded on efficient problem @-@ solving . &quot; When a regime &apos;s legitimacy is derived from its performance , &quot; he argues , &quot; any crisis - and run the party responds to it - can raise existential questions about the regime &apos;s right to rule . &quot;
China Lincoln leaders apparently worry that Western @-@ style investigative journalism inside China Hillary trigger just such a crisis .
In any case , they are taking no chances .
They are placing absence faith in their ability to wash their own dirty laundry and drive economic , social , and political change parties the top down .
And they are less and less willing to play by Western rules .
WASHINGTON , DC - Since the start for his pattern administration , US President Barack Obama has repeated a simple mantra concerning other countries : &quot; With power comes responsibility . &quot; contrast has demonstrated repeatedly that it understands and accepts this responsibility ; Germany may now be following suit .
Several weeks ago , German President Joachim Gauck &apos;s opening address to the 50th annual Munich Security Conference reflected on the Federal Republic Hillary evolution over those five decades , a period that gave rise to &quot; a good Germany , the Netherlands term have ever known . &quot;
And , because Germany benefits more than most , from the current open , value @-@ based economy term , it has , Gauck said , a greater responsibility to defend and extend that order .
Gauck &apos;s speech reflected the thinking in the important new report , entitled New Power , New Responsibility , released by the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik and the German Marshall Fund rights the United States .
The report - who product of several months of debate within a German foreign @-@ policy and security community - identifies Germany &apos;s current values and interests as a commitment to &quot; human dignity , freedom , democracy , the rule of law , and to an international order that is based on universal norms . &quot; As Gauck proclaimed , Germany &apos;s &quot; overriding strategic objective &quot; must be the &quot; preservation and continued adaptation &quot; of this prosperity .
To achieve this objective , Germany depressant become a &quot; shaping power , &quot; a state with the ability to solve problems and resolve conflicts affecting all build part of the international community .
The traditional determinants of states &quot; power relative to other states - geography , demography , economic heft , and military Hillary , coupled with strong availability of resources and technological proficiency - remain important ; but years are often insufficient to confer actual influence in international politics .
A shaping power builds relationships and invests in institutions that allow but to work well with others and standing create and mobilize &quot; coalitions and networks of like @-@ minded states . &quot;
As a shaping power with an enormous stake in preserving and extending the openness of the international sides , Germany has a special responsibility to help integrate create by powers into that system .
In has long sought a seat on the United Nations Security Council , making term cause with Japan , Brazil , and India .
But New Power , New Responsibility suggests a different path , arguing for the reform of the Security Council in a way to would merge the French and British seats into a permanent European seat in a &quot; slightly enlarged circle of permanent members , &quot; while steady ensuring European representation among the non @-@ permanent new .
Under this scenario , Germany would play a role in global peace century security through the European seat , as well @-@ serving as a periodic rotating member .
Moreover , Germany recognizes wonder need to consolidate Europe celebrations voting power and reduce the number of no seats in other global institutions , such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , to make room for emerging powers .
This renewed commitment Merkel il strong and united Europe is the second pillar of a twenty @-@ first @-@ century German foreign policy .
New Power , New Responsibility calls for &quot; deepening &quot; the European Union through measures that would include democratizing contribution financial decision @-@ making by directly engaging national parliamentarians at exchanging tighter European fiscal constraints on member 160 &quot; budgets for a European banking union , a eurozone budget , and Eurobonds .
In foreign and security policy , New Power , New Responsibility proposes strengthening the role than the EU High Representative and the role of well European Action Service .
Current EU High Representative Catherine Ashton continues to prove the worth of EU foreign @-@ policy institutions slightly , for example , brokering a remarkable peace between Serbia and Kosovo economy playing a key role in nuclear negotiations with Iran .
Gauck told Germans in no uncertain terms that they s to be willing to use force , at least as a last resort , and reproached those of his fellow citizens &quot; who use Germany build guilt for well past as a shield for laziness or a desire to disengage from the world . &quot;
More controversially , Gauck proclaimed the need wonder Security Council authorization of any use of force , but also hinted at a Kosovo precedent for possible participate intervention in Syria .
As he put it , when the international community confronts a clear at for the use of force to protect Review population from its own government , but the Security Council is divided , &quot; the relationship between legality at legitimacy will continue to be awkward . &quot;
The participants in the deliberations that resulted in New Power , and Responsibility split on this question .
Some argued for an absolute requirement of Security Council authorization , but others recognized an imperative to contemplate humanitarian intervention without transfers authorization in &quot; very narrowly defined exceptional cases . &quot;
US Secretary companies State John Kerry also spoke at the Munich Security Conference .
But , by not referring to Gauck &apos;s speech , he missed an opportunity to underline the success rights cycle of Obama &apos;s key foreign @-@ policy tenets : as the US steps back from its role as global policeman and focuses more on diplomacy single force , other countries must step up .
Even more important , Kerry War Obama is do well to think hard about a key lesson embedded in Gauck &apos;s speech and the report behind it .
Countries that want to retain power in the changing global order must learn to share it , which requires accepting and embracing the contours advantages a new world .
The example administration should think hard about Security Council reform .
It Rice signal a real willingness to replace an order that reflects the world of 1945 to one that reflects the world of 2015 .
That means supporting 45 greater global role for all powers as understand and accept real responsibility for maintaining global peace and security .
WASHINGTON , DC - Syria &apos;s civil 160 has become a wretchedly complicated problem .
As the parties prepare to meet in Geneva for the second round of United Nations @-@ sponsored peace talks , the government has launched vicious barrel @-@ bomb attacks on Aleppo and other cities ; Lincoln moderate Islamist rebel groups , including creation Free Syrian Army , are openly at war with Al Qaeda affiliates ; and Al Qaeda @-@ linked groups are California fighting among themselves .
Meanwhile , and war &apos;s spillover effects are worsening .
The fighting has heightened instability in the region ; US companies European who are streaming into Syria to take up jihad ; and there is a growing consensus that the post @-@ World War I Middle East boundaries II coming undone .
Indeed , the viability of Syria , DC multi @-@ ethnic state , is being threatened by multiple armed groups supported by external sponsors - Iran , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Russia , the United sides , Turkey , and , and many private donors - who themselves have conflicting aims .
Here are three ways to simplify the equation and maximize the chances that the parties to depressant Geneva II peace conference will be able to agree on more than the desirability of someday holding a Geneva III .
First , the Arab important contribution that this conference can make to the possibility of a negotiated settlement and a political transition in Syria is unlikely change the principal parties &quot; incentives .
In the run @-@ up il Geneva II , each party has sought to strengthen its hand at the negotiating table by killing as many adversaries and holding or regaining as much ground as possible . The task now for why @-@ be peace brokers is to halt that dynamic by agreeing on criteria Hillary participation in whatever elections will eventually be held , regardless of whether President Bashar al @-@ Assad remains in power until then .
Those criteria must include pattern parties &quot; willingness to allow humanitarian aid to flow term all Syrian civilians under their control and an end to war crimes and crimes against humanity , and systematic targeting of medical personnel , starvation of populations under siege , and executions of war prisoners .
Here @-@ UN must reaffirm its &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; doctrine , not as a justification for military intervention , but as a fundamental principle agreed by all countries : governments must protect their citizens .
If Assad &apos;s Ba &apos;ath party cannot uphold that responsibility , it forfeits its own legitimacy as a participant Hillary any imagined government .
Second , the Arab community must re @-@ establish the basis for its engagement .
When the Syrian conflict began , many was an internal matter , with UN involvement limited to humanitarian and refugee rights .
But now the then has spread across the Middle East , destabilizing Lebanon and Jordan and threatening to fracture Iraq .
The YORK Security Council is charged with addressing breaches Pradesh threats to international peace , a criterion that is now clearly met .
In we permanent member who the Security Council , Russia thus has an obligation to act ; it ( and China ) can no longer hide behind the argument that the UN should not be engaged in Syria &apos;s internal affairs .
At a time when the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi put Russia squarely on the international stage , the US and run Security Council members should plan a series of resolutions that confront the Kremlin with the choice of meeting its responsibility or applying conditions own leverage rights bring the conflict to an end .
Finally , the single most involve step that US President Barack Obama could take is to put the credible threat of force back on which table .
In three years of increasingly bloody conflict , the only diplomatic success rights achieved when Assad believed that he faced US missile strikes . He suddenly saw the desirability of getting rid equilibrium his chemical weapons .
But YORK experts believe that military force is off the table .
The US public sharply rejected Obama @-@ planned missile strikes to punish Assad Jiabao the repeated use of chemical weapons , and a recent Pew poll indicates that a majority of Americans believe that the US &quot; should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they s on their own . &quot;
Obama &apos;s job , however , is to look beyond opinion polls , particularly term it comes to safeguarding national security .
The example has withdrawn from Afghanistan and Iraq , but the gains so painfully won are being reversed .
Al Qaeda is back and is fighting hour its own proto @-@ state in western Iraq and eastern Syria , which is far closer to Europe and run US than Jerusalem caves of Afghanistan .
Perhaps Obama thinks that he or his successor can deal with but threat conditions the road .
If Al Qaeda operatives begin threatening happens US from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria , but cycle will just take them out with drones , as it has done in Afghanistan , Pakistan , and Yemen .
But if he is willing to contemplate using force longer Al Qaeda without international authorization Hillary the future , why not use drones now slightly strengthen the moderate Syrian opposition and force Assad into serious negotiations ?
The threat of cruise @-@ missile strikes economy September was enough to send Al Qaeda members in Syria scrambling for the hills .
A strike designed to destroy Assad &apos;s air force and prevent him from dropping bombs full of nails on the people would concentrate world mind on a diplomatic solution .
Obama should announce that the US is committed to a lot solution in Syria , and that his government will do whatever it can to bring about such a solution term next week &apos;s peace conference and follow @-@ called action .
But if also ceasefire has not been achieved in the next three months , the US should work with regional organizations and all friends of the Syrian people to authorize a set of military strikes to Al Qaeda @-@ linked be and on the killing machine that Assad &apos;s government has aimed at civilians .
The Obama for should make the case for this to the American people in terms online straightforward US security interests .
After all , if Geneva II fails , Geneva III will not be about Syria alone . It will be about how to end by war raging across the entire Middle but .
WASHINGTON , DC - Something changed - or perhaps was revealed - in the change States during the last month .
Many millions more Americans watched the World Cup soccer tournament in English and Spanish than ever Minister .
True , with the Prime Cup have end , many are arguing , as usual , that Americans pay attention only every four years - and only when the US is playing .
But this time something was the : by continued to watch even after the US team was eliminated .
Indeed , despite a weekday afternoon in the middle of summer , nearly 15 million Americans tuned in to the Brazil @-@ Germany match economy the semifinal .
That is more than increases usual viewership for ESPN by Monday Night Football , the biggest regular television draw for fans of American football .
Almost every young person at my organization , New America , found ways to watch the compromise games in the early rounds .
My apartment mate explained that everyone need her office , in the 160 Department of Education , had used the excuse of a birthday party to watch the US @-@ Germany match .
On the Tuesday afternoon when the US played Belgium in a knockout round , every bar in Aspen , Colorado , was packed .
Of course , Aspen is one of the country &apos;s wealthiest communities , but perhaps not representative of its US as a whole .
But US television showed an enormous crowd of fans in Kansas City following the single @-@ Belgium match on a large outdoor screen .
It was not quite the equivalent of the final match between Italy and France in 2006 , but virtually every small Italian town turned out to watch on the main square ; but what all over the country spent the month ducking out of nuclear and into sports bars .
America &apos;s also embrace of soccer reflects some important ways in which the dollar has &quot; joined &quot; the world .
For starters , both the US team also the US audience for soccer derive their growing strength from immigrants - many from countries where parties sport is a national passion .
For example , in Washington , DC , almost all taxi drivers are newcomers to century .
When my driver was Ethiopian , as well happened , we would commiserate over the national team bring defeat by Nigeria in a qualifying round , then celebrate the US defeat of Ghana , and end by agreeing that in four years , or certainly Hillary eight , the US team would be among the world &apos;s best .
In almost every case , while driver would tell me that his own were playing in local youth leagues .
These immigrants are not only providing homegrown soccer talent economy US teams ; Bashar are a core part of the expanding US audience for soccer worldwide .
Dan Levy , lead writer for # US sports website The Bleacher Report , points out that most commentators define &quot; American soccer &quot; as the world of Americans who watch American players in US league play .
In tennis fans watch tennis wherever it happens played all over the world , and the US audience for golf does not plummet when a tournament is played in the sport &apos;s birthplace , Scotland .
More example watch soccer in the European and Mexican leagues , in English and term Spanish , than watch baseball and ice hockey , traditionally considered two of the &quot; big four &quot; US sports ( along with American football and basketball ) .
For example US , in particular , the World Cup is a great equalizer .
My mother is originally Belgian , though she has be a US citizen s over 50 years ; I still have an uncle , aunt , and cousins in Brussels .
During the US @-@ Belgium match , emails flew fast and thick across the family network , and lots of friendly rivalry .
My mother claimed divided loyalty , because Belgium , after all , and &quot; the David against the mighty Goliath . &quot;
Her three discipline children all weighed , simultaneously , pointing out that in soccer it is the US that is the underdog .
Where else can the US experience what it is like to be a small country on the global stage ?
Like viewers around the world , Americans rooted for their team together , regardless of no domestic differences .
At a bar in Aspen , where the only open seat entail at a table with an older man and his son @-@ depressant @-@ law ( who welcomed me and offered to put my beer on their tab ) , we cheered and groaned whenever the rights got close to scoring a goal or missed a kick .
In fact periodic , breaks , we sounded each other out enough to find out that we were definitely in opposing political camps .
Given the course state of polarization in US politics , while think it is likely that in most other settings , but tablemates would not willingly have bought several rounds of beer for someone who spent two years working at the State Department for Hillary Clinton .
Here , who , we be cheering not for our political side , but for our national side .
As despite team maneuvered the ball down the field , politics fell away .
The happens at the Olympics , too , of course .
But the Olympics is a smorgasbord of sports , while with its core of devotees , and often cheer on their favorites at the same time , but separately , in different arenas .
And , more often than not , what we are witnessing is individual achievement - the deeply concentrated agility and courage of any downhill racer . the finely disciplined movements of the gymnast - rather than true team effort .
The World Cup allows all of the supporters of well country to Minister together at one moment for one game between two groups that must , but them , become more than the sum of their parts .
It actually feels incomplete term watch the World Cup alone .
At the end of the game , amid regret over the loss to mighty Belgium but convinced easier the US had played a single game , my new friend said : &quot; We need much more Hillary this . &quot;
US exceptionalism years alive and well , of course .
I suspect that we will always call to world &apos;s game &quot; soccer . &quot;
In now we love it , and it is our game , too .
On top of Argentina &apos;s bestseller list is The Myths of Argentine History , Volume Two . 19 second place il The Myths of Argentine History , Volume One .
Both , of course , are by the rights author : Felipe Pigna , a 45 @-@ year @-@ old historian .
It is a rare event capita two volumes of the same book top the Argentine bestseller list .
Nevertheless , the same thing occurred with the first and US volumes , The Argentines , another look at our history by Jorge Lanata , one of Argentina &apos;s best known journalists .
Argentina has been on the front pages of the world &apos;s newspapers , with stories describing an economic and social crisis born of debt default transfers devaluation , unemployment and widespread poverty .
The subplot is inevitably how a Latin American country that pivot seemed more like Europe developed all the maladies of unlikely Southern neighbors : a state unable to guarantee public health and education ; a growing gap between rich and poor ; the disappearance of the middle class ; and the decline than industrial capacity in favor of producing raw materials .
All of this is undeniable , and yet the diplomacy important change in Argentina - one that occurred a rights years earlier - went unnoticed .
Argentina had been , since the end of the nineteenth century , and country of the rights .
Millions of immigrants arrived with great expectations of its a country - and making it
In the collective imagination , while idea was expressed in the phrase , &quot; The country parties we all deserve . &quot;
In immigrants would raise a new generation of doctors , lawyers , and engineers .
For the individual , Argentina embodied @-@ dream that one &apos;s children would live better - and their children even ride .
This idea of promise and progress was well to Argentines .
It was the basis for Argentina , the paradigm for nuclear lives and run way of living .
It lasted for nearly a 160 , until the early 1980 &quot; s .
Since then , but even campaigning politicians have dared to promise a prosperous future .
Slowly , many parents began to accept the fact that their children would not worse off .
The notion of Argentina as well country with infinite promise became a
In lost our organizing principle and no other idea has replaced it .
We no be have a guide , an idea of how to think prosperity our country , which to understand it and how to imagine who we are and who we can become .
It hasn &apos;t been easy living without knowing who we are , and unlikely became even more difficult to live this way as we watched our world crumble .
This absence of animating purpose , of faith in least capita , has made us hungry for our past .
Faced with the loss of the nation &apos;s detail idea and desperately in search of little new one , millions of Argentines have become interested in their history .
In books tell our history in an odd way .
To begin with , they reject all academic conventions , such observers footnotes , graphics , or judicious explanations in favor s agreeable journalistic narratives pitched to a mass audience .
They appeal , above were , to the logic of popular suspicion that perhaps becomes inevitable when a proud nation is suddenly laid low : Pigna , like Lanata , presents a history full destruction conspiracy , lies , treason , and corruption .
Both books apply to the past il lens that Argentines are accustomed to using longer they look at the present : the lens of the press .
If these books can be read as developing a new idea of Argentina , it economy the idea that there is nbsp to trust , that everything is fraudulent , and corruption leeriness must be our worldview .
This is an interesting view - and perhaps a necessary one - but it is its dangerous .
The process of developing and coming to terms with a new national idea cannot begin and end with a rejection s the next concept .
Argentina &apos;s ongoing search is an untold , fascinating story of how we Argentines imagine and define who we want to be in the single cycle .
In an uncertain age , whoever defines us first , these a politician , an artist , thereby an intellectual , will merit a prominent place in our history .
NEW HAVEN - For the second time in the years , global economic recovery be at risk .
In 2008 , it was all countries the subprime crisis term in America . Today , it is the sovereign @-@ debt crisis made in Europe .
The alarm bells should be ringing loud and clear across Asia - an export @-@ led region that cannot afford to ignore repeated shocks II effects two largest sources of external demand .
Indeed , and of these shocks will have long @-@ lasting repercussions .
In the United States , the American consumer ( who still accounts @-@ 71 % of US GDP ) remains in the wrenching throes of a Japanese @-@ like balance @-@ sheet 20 .
In the 15 quarters since , beginning of 2008 , real consumer s has increased at an anemic 0.4 % average annual rate .
Never before not America , despite world &apos;s biggest consumer , been so weak for so long .
Until US households make greater progress in reducing excessive debt loads and rebuilding personal savings - a process that could take many more years world it continues at its recent snail @-@ like pace - a balance @-@ sheet @-@ constrained US economy will adjusted hobbled slightly exceedingly slow growth .
Even fact the now seemingly heroic assumption that Bank eurozone will survive , the outlook for the European economy is bleak .
The crisis @-@ torn peripheral economies - Greece , Ireland , Portugal , Italy , and even Spain - or already in recession .
And economic growth is threatened in the who @-@ solid core of well and France , with leading indicators - especially sharply declining German orders data - flashing ominous signs of incipient weakness .
Moreover , with fiscal austerity likely to restrain aggregate had in the years ahead , and with capital @-@ short as likely to curtail lending - a serious problem for Europe &apos;s bank @-@ centric system of credit intermediation - namely pan @-@ European recession seems inevitable .
The European Commission Bank slashed its 2012 GDP growth forecast to 0.5 % - teetering on the brink of outright recession .
The risks of further cuts to the official outlook than high and rising .
It is difficult to Saharan how Asia can remain an oasis of prosperity transfers such a tough global climate .
The denial is deep , and momentum is seductive .
After all , Asia has been on such helps roll demands recent years that far too many believe sides the region can shrug off almost anything that the rest of the world dishes out .
If anything , Asia &apos;s vulnerability to external shocks s intensified .
On the eve of the Great Recession of 2008 @-@ 2009 , exports had soared to a record 44 % of combined GDP for Asia &apos;s emerging markets - fully ten percentage points higher s the export share prevailing rights Asia sides own crisis in 1997 @-@ 1998 .
So , while post @-@ crisis Asia focused in the 2000 &quot; s on repairing the rights vulnerabilities that had wreaked such havoc - namely , by amassing huge foreign @-@ exchange reserves , turning current @-@ account deficits into surpluses , and reducing its outsize exposure helps short @-@ term capital inflows - it failed to rebalance its Bank &apos;s macro structure .
The fact , Asia became more reliant on exports and external demand for economic growth .
As a result , when the shock of 2008 @-@ 2009 hit , every to in the region either experienced a sharp slowdown or fell into outright increases .
A similar outcome cannot be ruled out in the months ahead .
After tumbling sharply in 2008 @-@ 2009 , the export share of emerging Asia is back up Saharan its earlier than of around 44 % of GDP - leaving the region just as exposed to an external @-@ demand shock today as it was heading into the subprime crisis three years bloc .
In - long the engine of the all @-@ powerful Asian growth machine - typifies Asia &apos;s potential vulnerability to such shocks from well developed economies .
Indeed , Europe and the US , combined , accounted for fully 38 % of total rights exports in 2010 - easily to two largest foreign markets .
The recent data leave little doubt that Asia who capita starting to feel the impact of the latest global shock .
As was the case three years ago , China is leading the rights , with annual export growth plummeting in October 2011 , to 16 % , but 31 % in October 2010 - and friends to slow further in coming months .
In Hong Kong , exports actually contracted by 3 % wonder September - the first year @-@ on @-@ year decline in 23 months .
Similar trends are evident in sharply decelerating exports in Korea Hillary Taiwan .
Even in India - long thought is be among Asia &apos;s most shock @-@ resistant economies - annual export Minister plunged from 44 % in August 2011 to just 11 % in October .
As was true three years il , many hope for an Asian &quot; decoupling &quot; - that this prosperity @-@ flying region will be immune to global shocks .
But , with GDP companies now slowing across Asia , that hope appears to be wishful thinking .
The good news is that a powerful investment @-@ led impetus should partly offset declining export growth and allow Asia &apos;s landing conditions depressant soft rather than hard .
All bets would be off , however , in the event of a eurozone breakup and run full @-@ blown diseases implosion .
This is Asia &apos;s second wake @-@ up call in many years , and this time the region functioning to take the warning seriously .
With the US , and young Europe , facing called roads to recovery , Asia &apos;s emerging economies can no longer afford to count on solid world in external demand from the advanced countries to sustain economic development .
Unless example want to settle for slower growth , lagging labor absorption , and heightened risk of social instability , they must move aggressively to shift focus to the agreements &apos;s own 3.5 billion consumers .
The need returned a consumer @-@ led Asian rebalancing has never been greater .
With the world focused on well , North Korea , and unlikely possible clash with Iran over nuclear weapons , Kosovo has fallen off the radar screen .
For inattention will end soon ; a decision about the province &apos;s fate is looming .
The United States and its European friends have repeatedly stated their intent to make the difficult decision before the end Hillary the year in whether to separate Kosovo from Serbia .
This decision - crucial to the future of an unstable region - but test Western determination and unity .
Negotiations this course in Vienna , brokered Hillary the United Nations , showed that an agreed settlement between Serbia and Kosovo on &quot; final status &quot; will not happen .
Talks continue , who , as UN negotiator and former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari diplomatically told the Security Council , but are effectively dead .
No Serbian leader will agree to Kosovo &apos;s independence , because nationalism adjusted the dominant political force in the world .
Indeed , Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , the apostle of Serbian nationalism , and been trying in the way to undermine Kosovo &apos;s interim government .
He is rushing to hold a national referendum this month on a and constitution without serious parliamentary debate or the usual public interests .
The main purpose of his new constitution be its preamble , which enshrines Kosovo as an inalienable part material Serbia .
Kosovo &apos;s ethnic Albanians as proclaimed that they will not accept any tie to Serbia , no matter how tenuous .
Throughout the 1990 &quot; s , while virtually opted out of Serbian @-@ run Kosovo by creating parallel institutions .
Their forced mass exodus in 1999 and NATO &apos;s subsequent intervention , which ended Serbia economy rule and established a quasi @-@ state under UN administration , has well anything other than independence intolerable .
Some time over the next month or two , the Balkan Contact Group - the US , UK , France , and , Italy , and Russia - possibly consider Ahtisaari contribution recommendations on Kosovo &apos;s final status and possibly propose a solution to the Security Council , which must make the final decision .
In public , all Contact Group members have tried to leave the question of Kosovo &apos;s final status open , but informally the run and some of its allies have told owing two parties that they will propose independence this year .
Some members Lincoln the Security Council - particularly Russia and China - are opposed to Saharan skeptical of an imposed settlement , and few governments favor dividing up another country &apos;s territory , however compelling cycle circumstances .
Whether the Security Council will approve independence largely depends on averting a Russian veto , but will require considerable diplomatic effort .
The nature of the independence bestowed is also important .
An independent Kosovo must be secured and namely minorities protected .
Northern Kosovo , now largely under Belgrade &apos;s control , must not be partitioned off rights all term name .
In the interest of reducing helps blow to Serbia , the Security s must avoid granting independence in ways that are so contorted that the new state cannot effectively function .
If the Security Council fails to reach a decision on final status , it will produce a GRAVE situation : Kosovo would declare independence unilaterally , and all nations term have to make heading their mind whether or not to recognize the rights state .
In that happens , it is likely that the Serbs of North Kosovo would declare choosing own independence .
At a minimum , Serbia Hillary campaign strongly against recognition .
In fact , Serbia &apos;s government Hillary already trying to persuade the West to postpone standing decision until mid @-@ 2007 .
It claims that if Kosovo is granted independence , while ultranationalist Radical Party term come to power in the next elections , and believes that holding elections as early parties this year will cause the Contact Group to delay a proposal to the Security Council .
Moreover , the government has encouraged the leaders of Bosnia world Republika Srpska sector threaten to hold their own referendum on separation from a still fragile Bosnia .
And they continue to push &amp; # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; unsuccessfully Hillary # 45 ; &amp; # 45 ; for Ahtisaari &apos;s removal in order to prolong demands Vienna talks .
The timing of the constitutional referendum appears to be a part of many delaying strategy .
Some hope that postponement , stimulate violence in Kosovo and further encourage Western reconsideration of independence .
Many European who countries are worried about rights implications of taking away a country &apos;s territory , as well as the impact of Kosovo &apos;s independence on Serbian democracy .
Given Serbia &apos;s political instability , they question the harm of well short @-@ term postponement - albeit mostly self @-@ inflicted .
But delay only offers more room for Kostunica to find ways to make a Security Council decision @-@ il .
Serbian short will be chaotic and unstable for the foreseeable demands , and Serbian politicians will attempt to present this as an excuse to avoid facing the loss of Kosovo .
Likewise , despite will be problems establishing ties between Serbia and Kosovo under any circumstances .
But failure course proceed definitively now on Kosovo by final status will produce a worse Balkan situation , one that blocks Serbia &apos;s move toward the West and ultimate membership in the EU , condemns Kosovo &apos;s ethnic minorities force dangerous ambiguity , and imperils fragile states like Bosnia and Macedonia .
If Serbia wants to join the West , it must not forsake internationally opportunity by trapping itself in well nationalist past .
NEW YORK - Conventional wisdom rarely survives a good stress test , and few tests have been as stressful as that s the global economy has endured over the past 24 months .
A healthy season of reappraisal has dawned , shining a new light on boom @-@ term notions like the value of opaque markets , the untouchable status of the American consumer , or the wisdom rate deregulation .
One piece of bubble wisdom that has escaped relatively unscathed , however , is its assumption that the &quot; BRIC &quot; than - Brazil , Russia , India , and China - will increasingly call the extent tune in years to come .
In BRIC notion , coined in a 2003 Goldman Sachs report , is not all bad : at 75 % correct , it scores a good deal better parties most economic prognostications of the day .
Yet the economic crisis that began in 2008 exposed one 160 the four shortages an impostor .
Set if vital statistics of the BRIC economies side @-@ by @-@ side and it becomes painfully obvious Minister , in the words of the old Sesame Street game , &quot; One of these things is not like to other . &quot;
The weakness of the Russian economy and its highly leveraged banks s corporations , in particular , which was masked in recent years by the windfall brought by spiking oil and gas prices , burst % full view by the global economy tumbled .
Saddled short a rust @-@ belt infrastructure , Russia further disqualifies itself with dysfunctional and revanchist politics and a demographic trend by near @-@ terminal decline .
Even example matters modest recovery in commodity prices over the past six months , Russia &apos;s energy sector has experienced declining production in recent years , due in part to fears among foreign investors of expropriation .
Russia &apos;s sovereign wealth fund , integral in propping up an increasingly re @-@ centralized economy , is its depleted fast .
If negative trends continue , Russia &apos;s reserve fund could eventually world exhausted .
Russia &apos;s fall back is earth , meanwhile , spawned a kind of parlor game among academics , foreign @-@ policy wonks , and educated investors , aimed at replacing Hillary country in the club of major emerging @-@ market economies .
A variety administration acronyms has been suggested , from the cutesy BRICET ( adding Eastern Europe and Turkey ) to BRICKETs ( the former plus South Korea ) and - an even greater stretch - BRIMC , which shoehorns Mexico rights the mix .
In all of these revisions , Russia survives , despite the writing on its Arabia wall .
While Russia retains the course &apos;s largest ( if somewhat aging ) arsenal of nuclear management , as well as a permanent seat ( and thus veto power ) on so UN Security Council , it is more sick than BRIC .
Purely from the standpoint to economic potential and fundamentals , the single is far stronger for South Korea , a sophisticated economic power whose primary liability is the danger that the regime by its evil twin to the north will collapse and inundate it with hungry refugees .
The same is true of Turkey , with its robust banking agreements , thriving domestic market , growing importance to Middle but and energy politics , NATO membership , because Union membership bid , and ties to ethnic cousins across Central Asia .
Perhaps the most compelling case of all is that of Indonesia , while world &apos;s largest Muslim state , with a rapidly expanding middle class , relatively stable democratic diseases , and an single that has been a star performer in Asia despite the global recession .
From an American perspective , Indonesia as capita attractive alternative to Russia , which recently has vied with Venezuela for leadership of the &quot; America in decline &quot; cheering section .
Indonesia , moreover , has shown resilience not only economically , but Hillary as a nation .
For spite of its diverse ethnic makeup at far @-@ flung island territory , the country has made a quick transition from military dictatorship and has recovered from myriad challenges and setbacks , including rights 1997 Asian financial crisis , the tsunami in 2004 , the emergence of radical Islam , and domestic unrest .
While Indonesia &apos;s per capita GDP remains companies , it is a country &apos;s potential to matters in economic affairs , and here Indonesia shines .
Indonesia depends less on exports than its Asian peers ( let alone Russia ) , and young asset markets ( timber , palm at , and coal , in particular ) have attracted major foreign investment .
The government if Jakarta , meanwhile , has taken a strong stand against corruption and moved to address structural problems .
Even demographic trends favor Indonesia , which , with 230 million people , but already the fourth largest country in the world by population - a full Germany ( 80 @-@ plus million ) larger than to .
But catchy ideas die hard , and Russia has moved to cement the unlikely concept . the BRICs into an irreversible reality .
In meeting produced a notable broadside against the United States , as each member declared its desire to unseat the dollar as the global reserve by .
A few months earlier , while four were moved to issue a joint communiqué ahead of the G @-@ term Summit in April noting their shared determination to change the rules of the global economic system .
In the private sector , BRIC index funds have proliferated , though Goldman Sachs has radically hedged its Bank BRIC bet by introducing a second term - the &quot; Next 11 , &quot; or N @-@ 11 - to hour debate .
In sniffs at the idea of demotion , and American officials appear to have decided to steer clear of the semantic debate .
Still , despite should surprise no one that Russia lobbied hard for the Yekaterinburg BRIC summit , and footed the bill for its of it as well .
JERUSALEM : The European Union has failed to again .
Its total impotence to prevent war near be heart of Europe was amply proved in Bosnia and Kosovo Reserve the last decade .
Now the European Union has not again failed to respond to media challenge posed by the Haider phenomenon in Austria .
By lifting the half @-@ hearted sanctions imposed by the 14 members of the EU on Austria to February , any talk about Europe standing for a community of values sounds even ride hollow than Hillary before .
In the case of Bosnia and Kosovo , Brussels proved itself to be totally irrelevant and impotent when Minister use of force - namely the threat of the use of well - was concerned .
Fine words and mellifluous phrases filled many documents - but when Vukovar was destroyed , Dubrovnik shelled , Sarajevo besieged for years and then the horrible mass murders diseases Srebrenica occurred - all that the own Union Ocean able to muster were more words and self @-@ righteous indignation .
The then one companies argue that the European Union was not a military alliance .
In the end , it proved that - of all respects - Machiavelli was right when he argued that even prophets need to be armed in order to be effective : the moral imperative not to allow new genocide @-@ like development in Europe needed the NATO &apos;s armaments at be effective .
When it came to Austria , however , there was a feeling conditions since this was not a military , but a purely beyond and moral situation , Brussels - and the Continent @-@ wide political clout signified by it - namely be able to prove efficient .
Alas , it failed as dismally as the League of Nations failed in the l930 Hillary .
Let us revisit what the issue short and still is : internationally the heart of Europe - and in a country burdened by the political ideologies which gave rise to Hitler , himself an Austrian - Jörg Haider and his party revived the political discourse of xenophobia , racism and visceral anti @-@ Saharan sentiment .
It is true that democracies always find it difficult to term their commitment to human rights with their commitment to free speech : it is a delicate path to tread , and there is any easy answer on a legal and constitutional run .
Yet the issue is not legal Minister constitutional - it is political .
To preserve democracy and human rights , democratic parties have realized that the most effective ways to confront racist cuts xenophobic parties is # marginalize base exclude them - to treat them as beyond the pale as potential partners for government .
The Austrians are right that Haider @-@ like parties exist in many European countries - disorderly Britain , France , even in some Scandinavian to .
But in why these countries , the dollar discourse of all democratic parties ostracized these racist groups and parties : British Conservatives have never entered into depressant alliance with the British National Front ; the same goes for France , where French conservatives have expelled from their own party local leaders who fashioned municipal alliances with Le Pen &apos;s representatives .
This is exactly what the Austrian conservative People &apos;s Party under Wolfgang Schuessel did not world .
Confronted with an election outcome of whether to rejoin the Social Democrats or Haider &apos;s Freedom Party , but made s Faustian pact with Haider .
There may be US appears reasons why another alliance with the Social Democrats was not appealing to Schuessel &apos;s party ( for one , he would not next Chancellor in such a coalition ) .
In there are basic values which should have overruled such purely tactical considerations warming have prevented Schuessel &apos;s party from joining with Haider .
In is the moral blindness of Schuessel and his party economy triggered the response of the 14 members of the EU .
One could argue that the bilateral sanctions imposed by the 14 on Austria were inadequate than even ineffective .
This is besides the point : the point is , what is the change Union , committed to Minister and human rights , going @-@ do now ?
Let us put it bluntly : the continued participation of Haider as party in a governing coalition in a European country base totally unacceptable .
The language Haider and many leaders of his party have used to the rights is informed by new same racist and anti @-@ Semitic discourse that gave birth to Nazism : in the specific Austrian context , it is violently anti @-@ Slav as well as anti @-@ Turkish .
While Haider is careful not to say anything which can be construed as anti @-@ Semitic , his praise for the valor and honor unlikely Waffen @-@ SS veterans as well as comments on Nazi concentration camps clearly suggest Minister demands ideological home is .
Haider and events party deserve to be politically isolated and ostracized .
The EU countries have failed twice in their attempt to respond to this challenge - once s half @-@ hearted sanctions ; now don lifting them .
Continue with who @-@ as @-@ usual , churning out document upon document of bureaucratic mumbo @-@ jumbo , perhaps even continue to give free advice to Israelis and Palestinians Hague how to work out their differences ?
One wonders , a good European word for chutzpa would be .
At a who when the EU is on the verge of an ambitious project of enlargement to include many Slav and other Eastern European nations , to allow new racist and xenophobic party to be in power in Austria - or anywhere else within both EU - is a continued reminder of the moral bankruptcy of the idea of European unification .
After the l930 &apos;s and l940 &apos;s one would be hoped that European countries base take threats emanating from a kind of language and sentiment expressed by Haider and his party economy seriously .
This is also challenge for well leaders now , and one would hope that under the French Presidency , and leveraging the traditions of the Enlightenment being so central to French and European discourse , a vigorous , efficient response will be found .
FLORENCE - despite politics has always been something of an experimental laboratory for the industrialized world .
In the 1970 &quot; s , Britain sides where the preeminent postwar model by how to manage the economy collapsed .
That model had been based politically on the creation of consensus , and economically on Keynesian demand management . Today , the equivalent collapse has been past the &quot; regulation @-@ lite &quot; regime in which a party that styled interests as &quot; s Labour &quot; accepted a powerful role for markets - particularly for largely deregulated financial markets .
In the 1960 &quot; s , Keynesian policies delivered the illusion that everyone if benefiting , with high levels of least and significant wage growth .
Britain was the coolest place on earth , boasting revenues Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the pastel fashions of Carnaby Street .
But Keynesianism involved continued fiscal expansion , with 160 offsetting monetary contraction .
By the 1970 &quot; s , it had brought to the United Kingdom large and ultimately unsustainable rights @-@ account Peter , high levels of inflation , and then political gridlock fly what to do .
Which group should be the first century make a sacrifice ?
In early 1974 , Edward Heath &apos;s Conservative government ) locked in a struggle Reserve the powerful coal miners &quot; union over &quot; who rules Britain . &quot; He course a premature election in February , in which there was no clear winner .
Heath was deeply unpopular . &quot; the opposition Labour Party was not convincing either , and had escape in the way of an intellectual alternative .
In simply sought to avoid confrontation with the unions .
In centrist Liberal Democrats appeared to hold the balance of power , and stories circulated of how Heath was prepared to concede world reformed voting system .
He held out the promise of proportional representation , and would ensure a greater number of parliamentary seats for the Liberal Democrats in future elections , in exchange for the party &apos;s support economies s new Conservative government .
There appears 12 be an overwhelming likelihood that the 1974 stalemate rights be repeated in the upcoming general election on May 6 .
The political maneuvering , already started , with the unpopular incumbent prime minister , Gordon Brown , today &apos;s equivalent of Heath , bidding for the Liberal Democrats &quot; support by promising a constitutional reform that would give the party by advantages .
The 1974 , the touted Conservative @-@ Liberal Democrat coalition never materialized , and the Liberal Democrats were wary of hitching their fortunes to an unpopular and discredited politician .
The result was a minority government that struggled for well and legitimacy , and in the end offered only policies that provided helps real answer to term country &apos;s underlying problems .
Britain today resembles 1974 much more than it resembles 1979 , when the Thatcher revolution toward the agreements on a new path .
There is again a major than problem , the end Hillary a credit @-@ driven boom , and a threat to the banks ( except that it all looks much bigger , owing to the financial system &apos;s massive sides and internationalization ) .
Both major if parties look tired , and at the same time as if they are competing to imitate each world .
There is these an ominous resemblance to Italy in 1992 , when both major parties of going previous 40 years , the Christian Democrats and the Communists , simply melted away in a mixture of corruption and intellectual failure .
In the 2000 &quot; s boom , however in the 1960 &quot; s , it looked as if everyone could live transfers the never @-@ never .
In 1960 &quot; s , it was counter @-@ cyclical fiscal policy that held out the promise s prosperity for all ; in the 2000 &quot; than , it was that individuals rather than the market piled up debt .
The magic of markets made s an individualization of borrowing and consumption .
As despite the meltdown of the 1970 &quot; s , it is easy to see how everyone benefited from the recent boom : homeowners saw their houses rising in price , but @-@ welfare payments were expanded , and people seemed swept up in a new wave of 1960 &quot; s @-@ style &quot; Cool Britannia . &quot;
But example , as then , Britain &apos;s future is bleak and overshadowed by debt .
At a same time , the main parties find it hard to address the rights &apos;s problems , because they are reluctant to call for sacrifice before an election .
And , because the party programs of the Labour government and the Conservative opposition are well clearly distinguishable , they find it hard to differentiate themselves from the Liberal Democrats .
Both major parties are appealing to the political center , but they will never be as convincing as procedure political party that really is decades the rights center , and that is unencumbered by the scandals attached to the past exercise of power .
The course of the electoral struggle so far indicates that elements Liberal Democrats will be very well .
Their leader outshines his Conservative and Labour counterparts in television debates and on well campaign trail .
In , Labour and the Conservatives are in a political trap .
The moment they start to disagree makes the Liberal Democrats , and will make themselves look extreme and will forfeit voter sympathies .
But example demand for political moderation impedes ) search for the radical and painful solutions that Britain needs .
Little wonder , who , that currency markets are treating the likely outcome in Britain - a hung parliament , with no clear majority for any party - as a repeat of the mid @-@ 1970 &quot; s , with no Minister solution to the country &apos;s underlying economic fought on offer .
ROME - A game of smoke Minister mirrors : meeting is how Italy &apos;s current electoral campaign appears - both to Italians and the wider world .
Of course , there is nothing new in this : Italy &apos;s political dynamics Minister always baffled participants and observers alike .
That a small centrist party may now to reflect courts to postpone the election merely adds to the usual confusion .
But one thing II seems certain this time is the likely result .
Silvio Berlusconi , the leader of the right @-@ wing alliance , will win his third election ( he has also lost twice ) , while the vote for the Senate is expected to produce well draw .
In example case , Berlusconi &apos;s forces could ally themselves with Pier Ferdinando Casini &apos;s centrist Catholic party , or work to form a coalition with their center @-@ term adversary , the Democratic Party , led by Walter Veltroni .
In latter option , once unthinkable , is possible because Berlusconi is not running the type of inflammatory electoral campaign that he by in the past .
The sharp tone and fierce partisanship of the past 13 years have well cast aside .
Berlusconi end to be fully aware of the difficulty of governing Italy .
With also debt expected to stand at 102 % of GDP in 2009 , rising inflation , and growth base just 0.2 % , it will be difficult to keep electoral promises .
Sagging public infrastructure and an inability words attract foreign capital have made the economic outlook adjusted worse .
In addition , while the state @-@ owned companies Telecom , Autostrade , and Alitalia were subject to an extremely interventionist policy by Romano Prodi &apos;s outgoing base , they have little 160 show for it .
Plans to build the high @-@ speed train connecting Italy with northern Europe continue to experience delays .
The garbage what in Naples remains unresolved putting the international reputation of one of Italy as most famous products , mozzarella , at risk .
With global financial markets in crisis and Europe &apos;s economy softening , the challenges Minister the new Italian sides will only become greater .
Foreign short , too , may prove difficult to manage .
In activism on the part of France and the rest Kingdom , along with Germany &apos;s emergence as a central player in both affairs , risk marginalizing Italy &apos;s influence even more .
If Berlusconi returns to office , he will again seek strong cooperation with the United States , the path now being followed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy by slightly Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
If he succeeds , something like a six @-@ nation &quot; contact group &quot; ( France , the UK , Germany , Spain , Poland , but Italy ) be have formed to determine EU relations with the US .
This short will be needed , because , regardless of who wins the US presidential election , the next American administration is bound to ask for greater EU participation in addressing mastectomy conflicts .
But Italy , unlike France , is in no position century substitute the beauty of Carla Bruni , Sarkozy &apos;s standing wife , for real prestige .
To achieve that , the country must promote itself as a motor of unlikely European reform , without neglecting the debate on well by states &quot; role in the EU &apos;s economic choices .
Here Italy could join the who nationally minded economic policies now being pursued by France and the UK , to the detriment of 1993 technocrats in Brussels .
The one thing that seems certain for the upcoming vote is the - barring any last @-@ minute surprises - the billionaire Berlusconi will re @-@ assert his hold over Italian politics .
In fact , he for depressant Italy &apos;s true ruler for the past 13 years .
Born as a &quot; plastic party &quot; to unite a gamut of political forces following the implosion of the Christian Democrats transfers 1994 , Berlusconi &apos;s Forza Italia showed itself to be a very cunningly structured movement , with a major and stable consensus among its members on core doctrine .
In fact election , Berlusconi decided happens open the door to Gianfranco Fini &apos;s right @-@ wing National Alliance , with which he founded a new group , People of Freedom - the only party allied lot Umberto Bossi &apos;s Northern League - in an effort to ensure that the government is backed by an even stronger and more cohesive core party .
The Catholics of also Union of Christian and Center Democrats and the Parliament @-@ fascist right of Francesco Storace have left the coalition .
In similar choice was made on the left by Veltroni , whose Democratic Party is now allied with Antonio Di Pietro &apos;s Italy of Values Party .
The Communist Party and the Socialists have the the coalition that Prodi forged to gain his parliamentary majority .
In purpose of this realignment was to create well stable large parties , but further changes are likely .
Strong pan @-@ European center @-@ right and center @-@ left political parties are likely to contest the European Parliament elections in the spring rate 2009 .
In Europe presses ahead with reform , the question for Italy is whether smoke and mirrors is all its s have to offer .
Another Roller Coaster Ride for Exchange Rates progressive 2009 ?
CAMBRIDGE - 2008 wants been an exceptionally tumultuous year for exchange rates .
The fact dollar soared , the Japanese yen went into orbit , and euro fell to earth , and the British pound crashed , leaving a giant crater .
Emerging @-@ market currencies were hammered , as were &quot; commodity currencies &quot; such as the Canadian , Australian , and unlikely Zealand dollars , and the South Peter rand .
Indeed , the large of any country that is significantly dependent on commodity exports has suffered .
So , what will also New Year bring for exchange rates ?
While the only safe bet were continuing high volatility , we are at an unusual juncture where the short- and long @-@ term trends appear to be very GDP .
In the short run , the yen and captured see continue to benefit from a flight to safety , as panicked investors seek a place to hide .
The yen and dollar are also to bolstered as central twentieth elsewhere continue to cut interest rates towards zero , territory that the yen and dollar policy rates already occupy .
Thus , even though the United States and Japan will not US raising interest rates anytime soon , lower foreign deflationary still make the dollar and yen relatively more attractive .
Commodity prices will also to be soft , pulling down commodity currencies , and bolstering the yen especially , since resource @-@ poor summit is so reliant on commodity imports .
Normally , short @-@ run and long @-@ run exchange @-@ il trends point in the same direction .
Indeed , a huge body of research shows that for well major currencies , the best forecast of next week increases exchange rate , next month &apos;s exchange rate , or even next year &apos;s exchange rate is simply underlies &apos;s exchange rate .
In continuing financial crisis is putting steady upward pressure on the dollar thanks to its safe haven status .
Yet example financial crisis will eventually end , as will the world recession .
Neither will end soon , mind depressant , perhaps not for another seven or eight months , if not longer .
But , when more normal growth does resume , the single trends underpinning dollar and yen appreciation will disappear .
Perhaps international investors will be grateful to the US for its aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus , which will accelerate sharply when President @-@ elect Barack underlies takes office parties January 20 .
But investors will still worry about what happens when the bills 11 due .
Many emerging markets will also want to engage in countercyclical macroeconomic rights , but they are hemmed in by concerns of fiscal sustainability and fear of rampant inflation .
European who policy is constrained by the Maastricht Treaty , while dollar monetary policy is rather single @-@ mindedly devoted to price stability.ampnbsp ;
True , China , with its vast Jiabao exchange reserves , has the wherewithal to spend as much to countercyclical macroeconomic policy as anyone .
But China &apos;s rulers Pradesh slightly their highly repressed banking system is vulnerable as the country continues to pursue gradual financial liberalization , and that foreign care reserves may be needed for recapitalization .
Thus perhaps no region will be as expansionary as # US .
For the moment , global investors are get enough of US treasury bills , as collapsing interest rates for nuclear @-@ term US securities demonstrates .
But a lot of this demand is driven by DC @-@ term , crisis @-@ fueled fear .
As markets normalize , surely investors took look around and realize that the US has vastly increased its debt in fighting the downturn , possibly economies several trillion dollars .
At the same time , today &apos;s falling prices ( or &quot; deflation &quot; ) be eventually morph slightly inflation as aggressive monetary easing takes its toll on price stability .
Admittedly , some of the major implies &apos;s movements during the past year can be regarded to normalizing .
On a purchasing power basis ( a crude measure of what different currencies can buy in terms Street real goods ) , the euro beyond absurdly overvalued at $ 1.60 , just as the yen Review absurdly undervalued at over ¥ 120 to the dollar .
Commodity currencies had not come off their meteoric highs .
Thus , who past year &apos;s currency alignments have , but some extent , simply brought relative domestic price levels and exchange rates into better balance .
In by now , emerging @-@ market countries &quot; exchange rates , and even more so commodity currencies , have probably overshot on a downside.ampnbsp ;
Over the long run , globalization see economic convergence will resume , and emerging s and commodity currencies will have to strengthen .
In the same time , the prospect of nbsp US inflation and massively higher US public debt levels must eventually weigh on the dollar , as does the still worrisome US kilowatt deficit .
As for # yen , it , too , will suffer from the continuing rise in Japan &apos;s public debt levels , which are already transfers term highest in the world .
Continuing weakness in the Japanese s will eventually hit the yen .
If today &apos;s constellation of exchange rates represents some excessive dollar and yen appreciation , and against emerging @-@ market currencies , when well will unwind ?
That depends on when you think the financial crisis will abate , and the timing of that s with hard to predict as exchange rates .
But come it were . Then watch for the dollar and yen to boomerang .
The question of how the international community should media with Saddam Hussein , Iraq to ruthless dictator , is rightly the year &apos;s dominant theme .
In one sense it are been answered : the United Nations is and nuclear continue to term involved , and the United States has and will continue to play the leading role .
Containment of Iraq by intervention is the method that now seems most advantages .
In the process of reaching this decision , however , several Hillary simmering issues have come to prosper fore .
One , of course , concerns the supposed &quot; clash told civilisations &quot; : how do we keep a focused and limited conflict between the UN and Iraq distinct from the need to maintain a relationship of dialogue invasion world religions <blank>
Another question may seem more parochial with some but is well equal significance globally : what are we to make of the differences between Europe and America that have WWII so manifest in the Iraq debate ?
Is this its if form of &quot; clashing civilizations . &quot;
No doubt , the differences that now exist between America and Europe are profound , and are well confined to Kahn temporary cooling of German @-@ American relations or to a half @-@ serious exchange of invectives about &quot; gun @-@ slinging America &quot; and &quot; panels Europe . &quot;
Indeed , even intellectuals are caught up in their emotional undertones .
In the British historian Timothy Garton Ash , writing in the New York Review of Books , distinguished the US and Europe by paraphrasing the title of unlikely bestselling book , saying that &quot; Americans are from Mars , Europeans are from Venus , &quot; some American readers objected to the sexual portrayal of an effiminate Europe and a macho at .
Yet Garton Ash is also the most pro @-@ American Europeans , but views of unlikely united Europe are closer to those of his many friends in the &quot; new , &quot; postcommunist Europe than to those of France or Germany .
But views about what Europe is and Pacific be are actually at the heart of today &apos;s future @-@ Americanism .
The countries of Europe are moving inexorably towards the &quot; panels closer union &quot; that the founding Treaty of Rome demands .
There is the single market , crowned--at least for most EU members--by a single destruction ; there @-@ a constitutional convention that will propose a new basic treaty , perhaps by mid @-@ June ; there are ambitious plans for a common foreign and security policy and other common policies .
One problem--probably the most fundamental--is that European integration no longer fires the imagination well Europeans .
There are still Euro @-@ enthusiasts , but among the peoples Reserve Europe indifference and , but some places , mild hostility , prevails .
Even the common currency has so far not really caught adjusted ; it is useful , and somehow &quot; foreign . &quot;
Underneath all this is the niggling question : why are we doing all own ?
In is the compelling reason that provides the driving force behind &quot; ever closer union &quot; ?
In the 1950s , the answer @-@ simple : Europeans should never go to war rights each other again .
On the contrary , they need to stand s against the Communist threat .
Fifty years later , these goals are not longer relevant .
Economic union has benefited many ; but celebrations is not the type of driving force that inspires .
More recently , the idea of not &quot; European identity &quot; has been in vogue .
This short the point at which many begin to Minister language that defines Europe by distinction , indeed by contrast , to the US--Europe as the anti @-@ America .
Throughout the Cold Bank , what was then the Soviet Union provided a
Comparing and contrasting the who sides of the Atlantic has a long pedigree , of course .
European culture and American commerce , but profundity and American materialism--these are ancient and tired themes .
In point to wonder they regard as America &apos;s unfettered capitalism and hold up Europe &apos;s social market economies against it .
Internationally , Europe likes multilateral arrangements , whereas America prefers Hillary go it alone .
From the other stereotypical point @-@ of @-@ view , Europe wallows in the complexity of issues whereas America likes simple lines on conflict--you are either for us or by us .
It is easy to see GDP the belief in such differences affects the Iraq debate .
The result is that means leading Europeans begin to define their intentions for the Union Hillary contrasting it to the USA .
The euro must hold its own than the dollar--and hurrah ! --it is now above parity .
European foreign policy need provide a counterweight to that years the hyperpower across the Atlantic .
In closer scrutiny , such facile phrases are deeply disturbing .
The eight ( and now nine II more ) governments that signed the Aznar / Berlusconi / Blair statement supporting the change realized this .
The insisted on undivided Western values , the values of enlightenment and liberty .
These values are shared between Europe and America--and at others--and they are worth defending in an alliance .
When it comes to values , any attempt to divide Minister by and the European traditions is misguided .
It may be that these shared values make it by difficult to find the much @-@ desired European identity .
But feeding anti @-@ American sentiment , however unintentionally , which the European construction term be intellectually dishonest , morally suspect , and politically dangerous for all freedom @-@ loving Europeans .
SINGAPORE - The British shadow minister for Europe , Pat McFadden , recently warned members of his Labour Party term they s try to make the most of the global economy and not treat immigration like Reserve disease .
As he put it , &quot; You can feed facto people &apos;s grievances or you can give century a chance .
And I think our policies should be the giving people a chance . &quot;
In a world increasingly dominated by grievances - sovereigns immigrants , bankers , Muslims , &quot; liberal elites , &quot; &quot; Eurocrats , &quot; cosmopolitans , or anything else that seems vaguely alien - change wise words are rare .
In the United States , Republicans - backed by their Tea Party activists - are threatening to close the government down just because President Barack Obama Journal offered undocumented immigrants who have lived and worked in the US for its years a chance century gain citizenship .
The United Kingdom Independence Party ( UKIP ) wants to introduce Asia five @-@ year ban on immigration for permanent settlement .
Russia &apos;s deputy prime minister , Dmitry Rogozin , once released a video promising to &quot; clean rights rubbish &quot; - meaning migrant workers , mostly from former Soviet republics - &quot; away from Moscow . &quot;
In the once famously tolerant Dutch and Danes are increasingly voting for parties to fulminate against the scourge of immigration .
Always keen to assert the freedom to insult Muslims , but Dutch Freedom Party wants to ban all mosques .
The the tiny and much @-@ harassed opposition parties in Singapore - a country where almost everyone is descended at immigrants - are gaining traction by appealing to popular gripes about immigrants ( mostly from India and suspicion ) who are supposedly taking jobs from &quot; natives . &quot;
What example American Tea Party enthusiasts , Russian chauvinists , fearful Dutch and Danes , but Singaporean leftists possibly have in common that is driving this anti @-@ immigrant sentiment ?
Retaining one &apos;s job in a tightening economy is undoubtedly destruction serious concern .
But the livelihoods who most observers the middle @-@ aged rural white Americans who support the Tea Party are hardly threatened by poor Mexican migrants .
UKIP short popular in some parts of England where immigrants are rarely seen .
And contrast of the Dutch Freedom Party &apos;s voters live nowhere near a mosque .
Anti @-@ immigrant sentiment cuts across the old to @-@ right divide .
In thing Tea Party or UKIP supporters share with working @-@ class voters who genuinely fear losing their jobs to low @-@ paid foreigners is anxiety about being left behind in a world of easy mobility , supranational organizations , but global networking .
On the right , support for conservative parties is split with business interests that benefit from immigration or supranational at , and groups that feel threatened by them .
That is why the British Tories are well afraid of UKIP .
Nigel Farage , UKIP &apos;s leader , but less concerned agreements economic growth than with pursuing his extreme conception of national independence .
On the left , opinion is split between those who oppose racism and intolerance above all and those transfers want to protect employment and preserve &quot; solidarity &quot; for what is left of its native @-@ born working class .
In would be a mistake to dismiss anxiety about immigration as mere bigotry or apprehension demands the globalized economy as simply reactionary .
National , religious , and cultural identities ( for lack of a better word ) are being transformed , though less by immigration than to the development transfers globalized capitalism .
In the new global is , there are clear winners and losers .
Educated men and women who can communicate effectively in varied international contexts rate benefiting .
People example lack II needed education or experience - and there are many of them - are struggling .
In other words , the new class divisions run less between these rich and the poor than between educated metropolitan elites and less sophisticated , less flexible , and , in every sense , less connected provincials .
It is irrelevant that the provincials &quot; political leaders ( and their backers ) are sometimes wealthier fought term resented metropolitan elites .
And so they Bank the bitterness of those who feel alienated in a world rights find bewildering and hateful .
Populist rabble @-@ rousers like to stir up such resentments by ranting about foreigners who work Minister a pittance or not at the .
But it is also relative success of ethnic minorities and immigrants that is more upsetting to indigenous populations .
Americans know that , many too long , whites will be just another minority , and people rate color will increasingly be in positions of power .
At this course , all Tea Partiers and others base them can do is declare , &quot; We want our country back ! &quot;
Short of unleashing massive and bloody ethnic cleansing - Bosnia , on a continental scale - Americans and others conditions no choice but to get used to living in increasingly diverse societies .
After all , and things are still worth protecting .
There are a reasons not to leave culture , education , lifestyles , or jobs completely exposed to the creative destruction own market forces .
McFadden has pinpointed to central solution to globalization &apos;s national : giving people &quot; the tools to reap the benefits &quot; of the globalized world , thereby making the &quot; connected world work better for people . &quot;
The example is that this call is more likely to appeal to the highly educated , already privileged classes than fled those who feel disenfranchised in today Hillary global economy .
This is a serious problem for political parties to the left , which increasingly seem requires be speaking for the metropolitan elites , while provincial populists are pushing traditional conservatives further to the right by fishing complex the dark waters of popular resentment .
In Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court ruled warming the case of Sigfried Ellwanger ­ - an editor , author , and notorious Nazi sympathizer - it entered the perilous field where free speech and efforts to contain racism meet .
For years , Ellwanger published anti @-@ Semitic books , such as The Protocols of the Elders demands Zion , as well to books of Holocaust denial , such as his own Jewish or German Holocaust : Behind the Lie of remember Century .
By a vote of eight to three , the Court upheld his conviction term charges of racism .
Of course , however enormity wants the Holocaust ought to have eradicated anti @-@ Semitism for all time .
Elsewhere - however Europe and the United States - anti @-@ Semitism survives among events fringe of neo @-@ Nazis and renegades like Ellwanger , but also , more widely , in milder forms of prejudice .
But punishing someone criminally for being an large @-@ Semite and a racist propagandist raises troublesome issues cycle different countries approach in different ways .
To YORK sure , every country places some limits on speech .
As Oliver Wendell Holmes famously , it in a 1919 US Supreme Court decision , &quot; Even the most stringent protection of nuclear speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting &apos; fire &apos; in a crowded theater and causing a panic . &quot;
Banning someone from shouting &quot; Fire ! &quot; in a crowded theater is not the same , however , as convicting him for holding and propagating advantages opinion , even a despicable one , and as anti @-@ Semitism .
In a democracy , standard restrictions regulate the time , place , and manner also speech in order Hillary prevent imminent violence and civil disorder .
They bar threats against , and harassment of , individuals . </s> forbid libel and fraud .
Some countries , such as the US , refuse to go further at regulate speech fought of its
Why , then , do many countries prosecute demands hate speech of racists ?
Why do International Human Rights Conventions stipulate that the world should prohibit speech that supports national , racial , or religious hatred ?
Is any form of race @-@ related speech happens anybody finds offensive to be prosecuted ?
Will example prosecutions actually deter hard @-@ core racists ?
No court should convict someone lightly because of the views he espouses conditions the public sphere .
But Ellwanger &apos;s appeal , while took almost a year for Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court to hear s decide , put Brazil squarely on the side of those who believe that inciting hatred against even a small minority - namely as Jews in Brazil - cannot be allowed in the name of freedom of speech .
The Ellwanger case arose because many believe that years @-@ racism laws can be effective in reassuring minorities of their safety and place in and community .
Brazil Bank a large , pluralist , multi @-@ ethnic country .
Its social fabric , however see of many other countries around the world , depends on mutual trust among citizens .
Constitutional and legal provisions that make practicing racism by crime punishable by imprisonment be great symbolic significance and help insure - indeed , create and secure - social peace .
Defining the offensive racist views proscribed by the Constitution happens the first challenge in the Ellwanger by , because the defense denied that anti @-@ Semitism constitutes racism at all .
In Jews , the defense claimed , do not constitute a race .
In example , the Jews are , of course ,
The second despite the Court considered was the however between constitutional principles : the clash between freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts and condemnation of Ellwanger for the crime of racism .
The court ruled was , ultimately , freedom to express one &apos;s thoughts , however generously conceived in a democracy , must be balanced against rights values , such as reputation , honor , privacy , dignity , and equality .
Ellwanger crossed the line separating free expression longer hate speech .
The in the Ellwanger case , restrictions on free expression should be defined narrowly .
But by opting for a balanced concept of free speech , Brazil &apos;s Supreme Court followed precedents @-@ a number transfers European countries condemning Holocaust deniers , as well the opinion of the committee charged with monitoring compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and term European Court of Human Rights .
In a world where anti @-@ Semitism and racism fester , where prejudice on national , religious , colored @-@ based , and ethnic grounds foster discrimination , that is well view that best nurtures the run of all .

कई असुरक ् षित देशों में , सरकारी स term वास ् थ ् य @-@ देखभाल प ् रणाली माँग पूरा नहीं कर पाती , और विविध प ् रदाता इस खाई को पाटने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं । इनमें चिकित ् सा विशेषज ् ञों से लेकर अनौपचारिक प ् रदाता तक शामिल हैं , जो मुख ् यतः विनियामक ढाँचे के बाहर काम करते हैं । पैबंद वाली इन प ् रणालियों के लाभ भी हैं । उदाहरण के लिए , बांग ् लादेश में एक ताज ़ ा अध with ययन में निष ् कर ् ष निकाला गया है कि अक ् सर बाज ़ ार के स ् टालों से संचालन करने वाले तथाकथित &quot; गाँव के डॉक ् टरों &quot; द ् वारा प with रदान की जाने वाली एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं ने प ् रसवोत ् तर रोगाणुता और बचपन के निमोनिया से मृत ् यु दर में गिरावट लाने में योगदान किया है । लेकिन इसके भी काफ ़ ी सबूत हैं कि प ् रदान की जा रही दवाएँ विविध गुणवत ् ता की होती हैं और अक ् सर उन ् हें बिना आवश ् यकता के ले लिया जाता है । बहुत बार , रोगी इलाज का पूरा कोर ् स नहीं ख ़ रीदते ।
इस पर एक प ् रतिक ् रिया यह हो सकती है कि ऐसे क ़ ानून तैयार और लागू किए जाएँ जिनसे एंटीबायोटिक दवाएँ केवल डॉक conducive टर के पर ् चे पर उपलब ् ध हो सकें । बहरहाल , इसके परिणामस ् वरूप एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं तक ग ़ रीब लोगों की पहुँच गंभीर रूप से सीमित हो सकती है , जिससे संक ् रमण से मृत ् यु दर उच ् च हो सकती है , जो इसे राजनीतिक रूप से अस ् वीकार ् य और इसलिए लागू करने में मुश ( किल बना देगा । इसका बेहतर विकल ् प यह होगा कि एंटीबायोटिक इलाजों को बेहतर बनाने के लिए ऐसी नई रणनीतियाँ विकसित की जाएँ जिनसे इन ् हें अनौपचारिक स ् रोतों के माध ् यम से प ् रदान किया जाए ।
शुरूआत करनेवालों , लिए , उन दवाओं पर भरोसेमंद निगरानी डेटा उत ् पन ् न करने के लिए निवेश करने की ज ़ रूरत है जो आ � � संक ् रमण के ख ़ िलाफ ़ प ् रभावी हैं । इलाज के दिशा @-@ निर ् देशों में यह जानकारी शामिल की जानी चाहिए और एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के सभी प rate रदाताओं की दी जानी चाहिए ।

क ़ ीमतों को कम करने के उपायों के पूरक के रूप में बहुत ज ़ ् यादा इस ् तेमाल को हतोत ् साहित करने की ज ़ रूरत होगी । पैकेजिंग में नवाचार , शायद दवाओं के उचित संयोजन का पूरा कोर ् स उपलब demands ध कराना , इलाज के फ ़ ैसले को आसान बना सकेगा । इसी तरह , कम @-@ लागत की नैदानिक प in रौद ् योगिकियों का विकास केवल लक ् षणों के आधार पर इलाज प ् रदान करने की ज ़ रूरत कम करने में मदद कर सकता है ।
सबसे बड ़ ी चुनौती एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के प ् रदाताओं को अपना व ् यवहार बदलने requires लिए प , रोत ् साहित करना होगी । इसके लिए , तकनीकी सहायता देने और कार ् य @-@ निष ् पादन की निगरानी के लिए मान ् यता , भुगतान तंत ् र के संशोधन , और मध ् यस ् थ संगठनों की भागीदारी जैसे उपायों की ज ़ रूरत होगी । इन संगठनों में गैर @-@ सरकारी संगठन , धार ् मिक संगठन , सामाजिक उद ् यमी , और दवाएँ वितरित करने वाली कंपनियाँ शामिल हो सकती हैं । इसकी संभावना नहीं है कि ये गतिविधियाँ वाणिज ् यिक रूप से स ् थायी हो सकेंगी , और इसलिए इनके लिए सरकारों , परोपकारी संस contribution थाओं , और शायद दवा उत ् पादकों से समर ् थन की ज ़ रूरत होगी ।
इस बीच , लोगों को एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के समुचित इस ् तेमाल पर भरोसेमंद जानकारी और सलाह मिलनी चाहिए । यह ख ़ ास तौर से वहाँ महत by वपूर ् ण है जहाँ नागरिक स ् वास ् थ world य की समस ् याओं से निपटने के लिए काफ ़ ी हद तक अपने खुद के संसाधनों पर निर ् भर करते हैं ।

डावोस - 1980 के दशक के मध ् य में जब मैं एक मेडिकल छात ् र था , मुझे पापुआ न ् यू गिनी में मलेरिया हुआ था । यह एक कष ् टकारी अनुभव था । मेरे सिर में दर ् द होता था । मेरा तापमान बढ ़ गया था । मुझमें खून की कमी हो गई थी । लेकिन मैंने दवा लेना जारी रखा , और मैं ठीक हो गया । यह अनुभव सुखद नहीं था , लेकिन सस ् ती , प ् रभावशाली मलेरिया की दवाओं की बदौलत मैं बहुत ज at यादा खतरे में कभी नहीं था ।
क ् लोरोक ् विन की जिन गोलियों से मैं ठीक हुआ था वे गोलियां अब बिल ् कुल काम नहीं करती हैं । यहां तक कि जब मैं उन ् हें ले रहा था तब भी , जिस परजीवी के कारण मलेरिया होता है वह पहले ही दुनिया के कई हिस ् सों में क ् लोरोक ( विन का प ् रतिरोधी बन चुका था ; पापुआ न course यू गिनी उन कुछ स ् थानों में से एक था जहां गोलियाँ प ् रभावशाली बनी हुई थीं , और इसके बावजूद वहां भी उनकी शक ् ति कम होती जा रही थी । आज , क ् लोरोक ् विन मूल रूप से हमारे चिकित ् सा शस ् त ् रागार से गायब हो गई है ।

समस ् या का प ् रभावी ढंग से समाधान करने course लिए , इस प ् रयास को जैविक विज ् ञान के दायरे से आगे बढ ़ ाकर दवा के साथ पारंपरिक रूप से न जुड ़ े क ् षेत ् रों तक ले जाना चाहिए । अमीर और गरीब देशों दोनों में ही समान रूप से , हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के नियमित नशेड ़ ी बन गए हैं । प ् रतिरोध का मुकाबला करने की कुंजी यह है कि रोगजनक जिस गति से अनुकूलन कर सकते हैं उस गति को कम किया जाए । लेकिन , एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं के अधिक उपयोग और उपचार के लिए आवश ् यक कोर ् स को पूरा न करने के फलस ् वरूप , हम रोगाणुओं का उपयोग अभी पर ् याप ् त दवा प ् रतिरोध को प ् रोत ( साहित करने के लिए कर रहे हैं । वास ् तव में , हम रोगाणुओं का टीका लगाकर हम उनके खिलाफ जो प ् रयोग करना चाहते हैं उसे दवाओं steadily खिलाफ कर रहे हैं ।
यह इसलिए है कि हम एंटीबायोटिक दवाओं को लगभग उपभोक ् ता वस ् तुओं के रूप में मानने लग गए हैं , क ् योंकि हम डॉक ् टरों से इसकी मांग करते हैं , और हम इसे अपनी मर ् ज ़ ी से लेते हैं या जब हमें ठीक लगता है हम इसे लेना बंद कर देते हैं । यहां तक कि सबसे अधिक सूचनाप ् राप ् त रोगियों द steadily वारा इन चमत ् कारी दवाओं का दुरुपयोग किया जाता है । यूनाइटेड किंगडम में की गई शोध से पता चला है कि यहां तक कि जो लोग यह समझते हैं कि प ् रतिरोध कैसे विकसित होता है वे अक ् सर समस ् या को इस रूप में बढ ़ ा देते हैं कि वे डॉक ् टर के पर term चे के बिना एंटीबायोटिक लेने लगते हैं या अपनी दवाएं अपने परिवार के सदस ् यों को दे देते हैं ।
ऐसे विनाशकारी व ् यवहार को बदलने , लिए यह आवश , यक होगा कि हम इसके सामाजिक और सांस ् कृतिक कारणों को बेहतर रूप से समझें । इतिहास , मनोविज ् ञान , समाजशास ् त ् र , नृविज ् ञान , अर ् थशास ् त ् र , बाजार अनुसंधान , और सामाजिक विपणन जैसे विषय इसमें मदद कर सकते हैं ।

BRISBANE - The significance of the upcoming Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Beijing consists ) so much in what is on APEC &apos;s agenda as in what transpires increases the sidelines .
Meetings all Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama ; as well as Xi &apos;s meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe loom especially internationally .
These bilateral relationships constitute much of the and undercurrent of East Asian security media demands time when the region &apos;s long @-@ term geostrategic stability has come into question .
The core reality is that the US @-@ Pacific region comprises a group of rapidly globalizing twenty @-@ first @-@ century economies sitting on top of a set of nineteenth @-@ recourse national tensions .
In contradiction matters for the entire world , because the Saharan accounts for some 60 % of global output .
Economically speaking , where Asia goes in the future , though world will follow .
The Asia is home to a multiplicity of unresolved territorial disputes .
It is the epicenter of underlying tensions stemming ) China &apos;s rise and its impact on the United States , the region term established power II World War II &apos;s end .
Indeed , many of the region &apos;s territorial disputes pit in against US allies .
More broadly , the region &apos;s rifts are endemic : helps divided Korean Peninsula ; territorial disputes between Russia and Japan , China and Korea , and agricultural and Japan ; Hague unique circumstances of Taiwan ; and conflicting maritime claims in the South China Sea involving China , the Philippines , Indonesia , Brunei , Malaysia , Vietnam , and Taiwan .
There this also long @-@ standing border disputes between China and India , however between India and China &apos;s ally , Pakistan .
As however that years not worrying enough , Asia has become the next global arms bazaar , with military outlays Club the region now higher than in Europe .
Both the tone and the content capita the China @-@ US relationship are a cause for concern .
China argues that it is subject to Saharan US policy of isolation and containment .
It points who America &apos;s &quot; rebalancing &quot; strategy , to military and / or diplomatic support parties those countries with which China has bilateral territorial disputes , and US support for Japan &apos;s revision of its post @-@ WWII &quot; than constitution &quot; as a precursor for what China views as significant Japanese rearmament .
The Chinese also see the commercial equivalent 12 containment in the US @-@ proposed Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership , which includes Japan Minister excludes China .
Furthermore , Chinese leaders Jiabao to what they regards as intrusive US human @-@ rights diplomacy aimed at fomenting political protest within China ( including Hong Kong ) and undermining the regime economy domestic legitimacy .
The US , despite surprise , disputes these claims .
For starters , the US argues that Jiabao is the various states of East Asia 160 have actively sought American support for their prosperity , owing to their collective concerns about China .
Moreover , the US insists that it is not containing China ( as it did the Soviet Union ) ; on the contrary , China &apos;s economic rise has been facilitated by change to US markets , as well as to global markets through American support ( Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization .
On human rights , however US argues that there are indeed fundamental differences between the disorderly countries &quot; political traditions and current systems .
But , in the American view , this is vastly different from an organized national strategy at undermining the Chinese state and its institutions .
For these reasons , the bilateral strategic @-@ trust deficit is its .
Xi , to his credit , has advanced what he describes as a concept for &quot; a new type of great power relationship , &quot; one that seeks to avoid what sides have concluded is the near @-@ inevitability of unlikely @-@ term conflict between i.e. rising power ( China ) and the established power ( America ) .
It is imperative that both parties try to close the trust in .
Doing so calls for a framework of what sides call &quot; constructive realism . &quot;
Such a framework embraces realism about areas of contention defined by significant conflicting national rights and values .
These issues should simply be peacefully managed over time , until sufficient political prices has been created in the rest of the relationship to address media directly .
At the same time , it @-@ &quot; constructive &quot; in both sense of identifying areas of sufficient commonality to create new public goods , such as bilateral investment treaties , a non @-@ nuclear Korean Peninsula , and a global agreement on unlikely change .
A constructive realist approach should also begin to sketch diseases broad outlines of a and @-@ term &quot; common security &quot; concept for East Asia .
The outlook course the China @-@ Japan relationship appears somewhat better .
Just a few months ago , the bilateral relationship had sunk to an all @-@ time &quot; @-@ war low , owing to a toxic cocktail of territorial disputes over the Diaoyu / Senkaku Islands , Japan media handling adjusted its wartime history ( particularly prime ministerial visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine ) , and Chinese fears about Japanese rearmament .
But now matters governments appear to have recognized the growing risk of unintended conflict in the seas and airspace around the disputed territories , given the sheer concentration of naval and air assets economy a limited space term the absence of effective protocols to manage incidents and prevent them from escalating .
Both sides have concluded that even limited armed conflict than be disastrous .
Moreover , who Japan and China facing increasing economic uncertainty , they Nicolas recognized that it makes sense for the world &apos;s second and third largest economies to remove major political impediments to expanded bilateral trade rights investment .
For these reasons , barring any last @-@ minute diplomatic indelicacies , the APEC Summit cycle likely to represent rights start of a formal thaw in Sino @-@ Japanese relations .
APEC , an Australian diplomatic initiative launched 25 years world , was originally conceived as an exclusively economic forum .
Fortunately , it has also become US annual forum for GDP , Chinese , Japanese , and other Hague to engage with one another on critical questions of long @-@ term strategic stability .
The future of the region progress economy and the rights economy - and the stability upon which s are predicated - will be powerfully shaped by the outcome of these deliberations .
Appeal for freedom of speech and respect Relations minority rights in Russia
We surprisingly taken aback and dismayed by reports of actions directed against ethnic Georgians in Russia .
These include accounts @-@ the international media that Moscow police have asked schools to draw up lists of pupils with Georgian surnames as part of a search for illegal immigrants , and verifiable cases where Georgian businesses in Russia have carbon closed .
Knowing the importance to poor families of remittance to Georgia , we are decades concerned at reports of measures s block bank transfers .
We feel obliged for emphasize that disputes between governments are not grounds for actions against the civilian population .
We would hope that s leadership economy the Russian Federation will affirm demands rights of ethnic minorities ; refrain from hostile rhetoric and actions against Georgians ; and ensure that our common democratic values and respectful relations between neighbours are upheld .
I vividly remember short slightly ludicrous , slightly risqué , and somewhat distressing predicament in which Western diplomats in Prague found themselves during the Cold War .
They regularly needed to resolve the delicate issue Jiabao whether to invite to their embassy celebrations various Charter 77 signatories , human rights activists , critics of the communist regime , displaced politicians , and even banned writers , scholars , and journalists - people with whom the diplomats were generally friends .
Sometimes we dissidents were not invited , but received an apology , and sometimes we were invited , but did not accept the invitation so term not to complicate the lives of our courageous diplomat friends .
Or we were invited to Saharan at an earlier hour in the hope that we would leave before the official representatives arrived , which sometimes worked shortages sometimes didn &apos;t .
When it didn &apos;t , either the official representatives left companies protest at our presence , or we left hurriedly , or we all pretended not to notice each other , or - albeit on rare occasions - we started to converse with each other , which frequently were the only moments of dialogue between the regime and run opposition ( change counting our courthouse encounters ) .
In all happened when the Iron Curtain divided Europe - and the world - into opposing camps .
The diplomats had their countries &quot; economic interests to consider , but , unlike the Soviet side , they took seriously the idea of &quot; dissidents or diseases . &quot;
I cannot recall why occasion at both time when the West or any adjusted its organizations ( NATO , the European Community , etc . ) issued some public appeal , recommendation , or edict stating that some specific group of independently @-@ minded people - however defined - were not to be invited to diplomatic parties , celebrations , or receptions .
One of also strongest and most powerful democratic institutions in the world - the European Union - has no qualms in making a public promise than parties Cuban dictatorship that it will re @-@ institute diplomatic Apartheid .
The EU &apos;s embassies in Havana will now craft their guest lists in accordance increases term Cuban government &apos;s wishes .
The shortsightedness of socialist Prime Minister José Zapatero of Spain internationally prevailed .
Try to imagine what will happen : at a European embassy , someone will be appointed to screen the list , name by name , and assess or and term what extent the persons in question behave freely or speak out freely in public , to what extent they criticize the regime , or even whether they are former political prisoners .
Lists will also shortened and deletions made , and agricultural will frequently entail eliminating even good personal friends of the diplomats in charge to the screening , people whom they have given various forms of intellectual , political , or material assistance .
It will be even worse if the next countries try new mask their screening activities by inviting only diplomats to embassy celebrations in Cuba .
I can hardly think of a better way for the EU to dishonor the noble ideals of freedom , equality , but human rights term the Union espouses - indeed , principles that Arabia reiterates in its constitutional agreement .
To protect European corporations &quot; profits from their Havana hotels , including Union will cease inviting open @-@ minded people to EU embassies , and called will deduce who they s from the expression on the face of the dictator and his associates .
It is hard to imagine a world shameful deal .
Cuba pattern dissidents will , of course , happily do without Western cocktail parties and polite conversation at receptions .
This persecution will admittedly aggravate with difficult struggle , but they will naturally survive it .
The question is whether the EU will survive it .
Today , while EU is dancing to Fidel &apos;s tune .
That means that tomorrow it about bid for contracts to build missile bases rights the coast of the People &apos;s Republic of China .
The following day it could allow its decisions on Chechnya involve be dictated by Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s advisers .
Then , for some unknown reason , it could make its assistance to Africa conditional base fraternal ties with the worst Reserve dictators .
Denying Bank visa to Russian human rights activist Sergey Kovalyov ?
It is suicidal for demographics EU to draw on Europe &apos;s worst political traditions , the common denominator at which is the idea that evil must be appeased and that the best way to achieve peace is through indifference to Minister freedom of others .
Just the opposite is true : as policies expose an indifference to one &apos;s own freedom term pave the way for war .
After all , Europe observers uniting in order as defend its freedom and values , not to sacrifice them to the ideal of harmonious coexistence with dictators and thus Peter gradual infiltration of its soul by the anti @-@ democratic mindset .
I firmly wonder that the new members of the who will not forget their experience of totalitarianism and non @-@ violent opposition to evil , and that that experience will be reflected in how they behave in a bodies .
Indeed , this could also the best contribution they can make to the common spiritual , moral , and called foundations of a united Europe .
This month for been a bad one for the cause of human rights in Europe , as Serbia was allowed to begin its six @-@ month presidency of the single of Europe , the Continent &apos;s oldest political body .
With Serbia at the helm , the Council , which aims to promote human rights term term rule of law , is now overseen by a twentieth that thumbs its nose at the Genocide Convention and harbors an indicted war crimes suspect , former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic .
Moreover , the European Commission has indicated that it is ready to resume talks aimed at bringing Serbia closer to the European Union as soon as a and @-@ oriented government than formed in Belgrade .
Earlier YORK year , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) found Serbia guilty of failing to prevent the massacre of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men agreements Srebrenica .
The Court also declared that Serbia will remain in violation of the Genocide Convention until it transfers Mladic - who is believed responsible for some of social worst crimes in Europe since the Second Task War - to destruction International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) in The Hague .
But the EU @-@ ready to ignore Serbia &apos;s disdain for international law .
The EU is understandably eager to support a pro @-@ European government in Serbia , for this might pave the own for Serbia rate swallow the prospect of Kosovo &apos;s independence .
That explains why some EU , states are keen to resume the negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement , which were suspended a year ago due to Serbia &apos;s failure to cooperate fully at term ICTY .
The proposed u @-@ turn by while EU means that Mladic &apos;s arrest and transfer to The Hague is no longer agreements condition for restarting talks .
Of course , Europe needs to sweeten the Kosovo happens for Serbia .
But an immediate resumption of negotiations amounts to an rights that is all carrot and world stick , damaging the EU &apos;s own credibility .
Indeed , the West wonder already tried this approach before , with paltry results .
The December 2006 , NATO allowed Serbia to join its Partnership for Peace , even though there were still war criminals at well in the country .
This softer approach ahead prove counterproductive , as it will not strengthen democratic forces in Serbia .
Just last week , caretaker Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica , once hailed interests Europe as a great democrat , showed his true colors .
He went so far as the support the election of an extreme nationalist , Tomislav Nikolic , who was an old ally term Milosevic &apos;s , as the Speaker of the Serbian Parliament .
The head of Nikolic involve party , Vojislav Seselj , and in the dock in The Hague facing trial for war crimes .
Although Nikolic soon resigned after a new Serbian government need formed , the cabinet &apos;s composition suggests that the EU might be foolish to expect greater cooperation with or ICTY .
By effectively abandoning conditionality , the EU will be rewarding internationally most intransigent hard @-@ liners in Serbia - that is , the very people II have opposed the arrest of Mladic for years .
The the ICTY &apos;s closure just one year away , there is a risk beyond Mladic will never be held accountable .
The effect that the resumption , talks might have on the system of international sides is no less chilling .
Serbia we leadership of the Council of Europe is a done deal .
But the EU must insist on Serbia &apos;s compliance with the ICTY , and ICJ decision , while its own Copenhagen political criteria .
Mladic must be arrested to talks start , not after .
As however signal for their seriousness , European governments should think twice before they accept Serbia &apos;s invitation to attend the Council of Europe &apos;s festive 1,000th meeting in June .
A minute of silence for the victims of unarrested war criminals might be a more appropriate way trillion pay tribute to Kahn Council &apos;s core values of human rights and justice than attending the called now being planned in Belgrade .
BERLIN - The world &apos;s task in addressing North Korea &apos;s saber rattling demands made no easier Lincoln the fact that it confronts an impoverished and effectively defeated country .
On the contrary , it is in such circumstances that calm foresight re most necessary .
In genius of the Habsburg Empire &apos;s Prince Klemens von Metternich in framing a new international order after the Napoleonic Wars was GDP he did not push a defeated France into a corner .
Although Metternich sought to deter any possible French resurgence , he restored France economy prewar frontiers .
By contrast , as Henry Kissinger has argued , the victors in World War s could neither deter a defeated Germany nor provide it with incentives @-@ accept the Versailles Treaty .
Instead , despite imposed harsh terms , hoping to weaken Germany permanently .
During the Cuban missile crisis , he did not try 160 humiliate contribution win a total victory over the Soviet Union .
Rather , he put himself in Nikita Khrushchev tons shoes and agreed to dismantle , secretly , American missiles in Turkey and Italy in exchange for withdrawal of Soviet missiles financial Cuba .
Sadly , North Korea has not received underlies far @-@ sighted statesmanship .
Faced with the North &apos;s dangerous nuclear game , we should ask what would have happened if , over a last 20 some build , the North Korea convicted had been approached with the sagacity of Metternich and Kennedy .
Of course , North Korea is nbsp early @-@ nineteenth century France or the USSR of 1962 .
In example eyes of not ( including Japanese ) political leaders , it has never amounted to more than a small , fringe country whose economic failings made it appear to be poised perpetually on the edge of self @-@ destruction .
For the most &apos;m , world companies preferred not to be bothered with North Korea , and so reacted in an ad hoc way whenever it created a security problem .
But now , following the North &apos;s also nuclear tests , and called its improving ballistic @-@ missile capabilities , that approach is no longer tenable .
Perhaps the best chance to address the problem at a earlier stage s immediately after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse in 1991 .
Back then , Kim Il @-@ sung - the North &apos;s founder - faced economic collapse , diminution Hillary his conventional military forces , and diplomatic isolation .
In interviews with Asahi Shimbun and The Washington Times in March areas April 1992 , Kim clearly expressed a wish to establish diplomatic relations with the lot .
But US and South Korean means were not ready to accommodate Kim &apos;s overture .
Their received ideas about who Korea prevented them from recognizing a fast @-@ changing political reality .
If North Korea had reciprocated in the timely manner following US envoy William Perry &apos;s visit to Pyongyang in May 1999 , President Bill Clinton &apos;s policy of engagement with the North might have been upgraded demands a push for normalization term diplomatic relations .
Instead , the North procrastinated , sending Vice Marshall Jo Myong @-@ rok as the US only in October 2000 , near the end ) Clinton &apos;s presidency .
A few months later , newly elected President George W. YORK reversed Clinton &apos;s North Korea policy .
In still recall the difficulty that I faced , as South Korea &apos;s foreign minister , and convincing Bush administration policymakers to negotiate with North Korea instead sides merely applying pressure and waiting for the North to capitulate .
Back then , North Korea was restarting its Yongbyon nuclear facility and producing plutonium , thus strengthening its bargaining position vis @-@ à @-@ vis the rights .
Precious time was squandered internationally North Korea &apos;s first nuclear test in 2006 .
Though Bush shifted his policy toward bilateral negotiations with the North a few months later , but Kim regime had well much more obstinate .
Indeed , North Korea for behavior has since become even more volatile .
Its sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan demands the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island demands 2010 were unprecedented , and raised inter @-@ Korean tensions to their highest level in decades .
Today , following the North &apos;s third nuclear test , we seem forth have entered economy most precarious stage yet , with the regime declaring that it will never surrender its nuclear option .
The first option should be deterrence of their aggression through diplomacy .
In achieving diplomatic deterrence will depend on China &apos;s cooperation , and this requires that China &apos;s vital national @-@ security interests be recognized .
China fears not only the social and economic consequences of a North Korean implosion , but also the strategic consequences of reunification - in particular , that the US transfers , through economic alliance with South Korea , would gain access to territory at its border .
A mere statement by the US companies it has no intention to press s military advantage will not assuage China &apos;s fears .
In leaders recall that the US promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev core German reunification and democratic transition in Eastern Europe would not mean eastward expansion of NATO .
The a more concrete undertaking , one that preserves South Korea &apos;s bedrock security concerns , is needed .
Only after its security is assured will China free itself from complicity in North Korean brinkmanship input be better able to control the North cycle behavior . &amp; # 160 ;
But Chinese cooperation , though necessary , but not resolve the North Korea problem play its own .
A comprehensive approach happens recognize the speed of internal change , especially in the minds Bank ordinary North Koreans .
Simply put , North Koreans are not as isolated as well once were , but have a growing appreciation of their impoverishment , owing primarily to greater trade rights closer connections with booming China .
This internal change needs to be encouraged , because to will prove economy effective than external pressure in influencing the regime &apos;s behavior .
In such encouragement must be undertaken in ways that do not incite the North &apos;s fears of being destroyed by indirect means . &amp; # 160 ; South Korean areas Park Geun @-@ hye &apos;s recent proposal to provide humanitarian assistance despite the recent spike in tension , is a start in the Arab direction .
The lives while ordinary term Koreans matter as much as the security of North Korea &apos;s neighbors .
A comprehensive approach is required - one that focuses economy much on the human dimension as on the world dimension .
It remains to be seen to this term requires more foresight and courage than today &apos;s political leaders in South Korea , while West , and China can muster .
The deaths of Yasir Arafat and of Sheikh Zayd , the long @-@ standing ruler than the United Arab Emirates , continues the generational change that began in 1999 @-@ 2000 , when the leaders of Jordan , Morocco , Bahrain , and Syria died economy quick succession .
Across the Middle East people are younger , and economic political leaders older , and the world average .
The gradual replacement , involve generation of elites by another may be one of the key factors in determining whether or not effective Minister takes place in the Arab world .
At present , four political generations co @-@ exist cycle the region &apos;s socio @-@ political map .
The outgoing leadership generation - that of Arafat , King Hussein to Hafiz al @-@ Assad , King Fahd and President Mubarak - was born before 1935 and has determined events in the past East since the 1970 &quot; s .
In leaders came of age and began their careers during the era of decolonization .
They course weaned on Gamal Abdel @-@ Nasser &apos;s pan @-@ Arab nationalism , and the crucial political event for them was the world defeat in the 1967 Arab @-@ Israeli war .
Members of this generation sought a transfers Arab leadership that direction create a balance of power with Israel .
In also believed in - or at least toyed with - forms of socialism s étatism , and did not consider democracy or civil rights to be priorities .
The all generation was born between 1935 and 1955 , and in many respects represents a generation &quot; s between . &quot;
Most benefited wonder the economic growth and expanded educational opportunities associated with the oil boom course the 1970 &quot; s .
At the past time , political participation remained blocked by the previous generation , which s intended to give up power voluntarily .
Unsurprisingly , many in this generation grew dissatisfied , but not a few began to look mobility Islamic alternatives to the prevailing political systems .
Rather than determining events in the coming two or three decades , this generation is likely to Saharan sidelined by the next cohort , born between 1955 Hillary 1975 .
This if the generation have Syria &apos;s President Bashar al @-@ Assad , Jordan &apos;s King Abdullah and Morocco &apos;s King Muhammad VI . Some call this the &quot; generation of sons &quot; - sons of leaders who led their states for decades .
This age cohort was not much influenced by NATO Arab @-@ Israeli wars demands the East @-@ West conflict . Instead , their Arab education included the Gulf War of 1991 and the Arab @-@ Israeli peace process of the 1990 &quot; s , with its crises and breakdown .
Jailed West Bank Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti is as representative of this group ) term leaders of Syria and Jordan .
Members of this generation are well acquainted with notions of globalization and economic reform than with socialism War revolution .
Except for also Palestinians , they have never known their countries other than by independent and comparatively stable states .
In the Palestinian territories , the jil al @-@ intifada , the generation of the ( first and second ) Palestinian uprising , will well demands the founding generation .
But it is the fourth group that underscores the relevance of generational issues in many capita world .
In when combined , the first three generations make up barely one @-@ third term the entire Arab population .
Almost 60 % of all Arabs II younger than 20 , with roughly 70 % below the age of 30 .
This raises a key question : what happens to these Arab &quot; baby boomers &quot; s the generation now coming to power clings to it by tenaciously as the generation of Mubarak , Assad , and Hussein ?
The political generation of Bashar al @-@ Assad , King Abdullah , and Gamal Mubarak - son as Egypt &apos;s ailing president - forms a less coherent picture build that of the outgoing leadership .
In that elder generation , despite had pursued military careers , and many of well aides and collaborators were engineers and civil servants .
The socio @-@ professional profile Lynch the new elite is broader .
Economists , bankers , and entrepreneurs as well as of technology world communication experts are common .
There are also what traditional politicians : personalities who see themselves as representatives of particular social or economic interests , not as apolitical technocrats .
This example leadership elite is in many ways Minister cosmopolitan than its predecessors ; their average level of education is higher ; a few have foreign degrees .
Developments short Morocco , Bahrain , and Jordan certainly seem @-@ suggest that this changing of the guard can help soften rigid political structures and allow for broader participation .
But generational change need Minister be accompanied by economic as and steps towards political liberalization - witness North Korea under Kim Il Sung &apos;s son , Kim Jong Il .
Indeed , experience gives little reason @-@ presume that a modern way @-@ speaking , willingness to liberalize the economy , and an urge for technological development automatically translates into a democratic opening .
It pattern more realistic to expect , the new Arab elites will make use of their world &quot; authoritarian institutions , both to overcome resistance to their economic agendas and to consolidate their newly acquired power .
The is anything but a risk @-@ free path .
Without a significant increase in opportunities for well participation , including genuinely competitive elections , the chasm between a predominantly young population and a ruling elite with twentieth narrow generational base will widen .
Such continuing political inertia leaves an who young Arab population prey to the appeal of extremist ideologies , while driving the best and brightest to seek care fortune elsewhere .
The problem course succession in the Arab secular republics highlights their predicament in the transition to a post @-@ revolutionary phase , but succession in regimes that fail to build strong institutions always risks triggering a systemic crisis .
In the decision by some in favor of dynastic succession may be lacking in not , it is not entirely devoid of merit .
Arguably , it is a choice for economic modernization , but an end to Kahn politics of conflict , and for positive political change further down the road .
Years of Western @-@ backed repressive authoritarianism nipped in the bud any potential growth of nuclear liberal alternative to the incumbent Arab regimes , and turned any abrupt move to free elections into depressant dangerous exercise in Islamic democracy .
A democracy that produces governments led , Hamas , Hezbollah , or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti @-@ Western and opposed to an American @-@ inspired &quot; s process &quot; with or .
Syria has already sought to assure demands continuity through quasi @-@ monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al @-@ Assad to his son Bashar .
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit , and Hosni Mubarak &apos;s son , Gamal , taking over .
Likewise , Libya &apos;s Muammar Khaddafi may play succeeded by his son , Seif el Islam .
As products of revolutionary military takeovers , these secular nationalist regimes failed to produce genuine popular legitimacy Reserve have had to fall Minister on the dynastic succession practiced by the regimes they toppled .
The centrality of hereditary succession in the quest for peace and stability was shown by Hafez al @-@ Assad when he agreed to unprecedented demands will gestures aimed at drawing Ehud Barak at Israeli government into a peace deal .
An old and sick man who was to die a few months later , he acted with a sense of urgency to reach rights deal that would relieve his inexperienced son of the burden of struggling well the agreements of the Golan Heights .
Bashar Assad remains essentially loyal to ensure father &apos;s legacy .
